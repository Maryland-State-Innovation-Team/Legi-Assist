Analysis 
 
Current Law/Background:  The practice of physical therapy in Maryland is regulated by 
State Board of Physical Therapy Examiners. The board was created by the 
General Assembly in 1947 and is housed within MDH. The mission of the board is to 
protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Marylanders through the promotion and 
oversight of the Physical Therapy Practice Act. The board comprises eight members:

five licensed physical therapists; one licensed physical therapy assistant; and 
two consumers. 
 
The board is one of approximately 60 regulatory entities and activities subject to 
termination unless reauthorized periodically through statute. Under MPEA, these entities 
may also be subject to an evaluation by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability (OPEGA) within DLS prior to their termination. However, OPEGA may 
conduct an evaluation only if directed by specified entities or by legislation. The board is 
scheduled to terminate July 1, 2024; OPEGA was not asked to conduct an evaluation prior 
to its termination. Accordingly, the board has requested reauthorizing legislation.
