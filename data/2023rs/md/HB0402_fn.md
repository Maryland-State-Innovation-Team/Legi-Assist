member must serve for a term of one year beginning on July 1 after the election of the

by the board and deliver a speech to the student body of Kent County High School 
(currently the only high school in the county). To elect one of the applicants, any 
high school student in the county may vote directly for the student member candidates in 
an election held before May 1 each year. Notice of the results of the election must be 
reported to the County Superintendent of Schools on or before May 1 each year. 
 
If a student member is unable, ineligible, or disqualified to complete the student member’s 
term of office, the board must appoint a qualified student to serve for the remainder of the 
term. 
 
The student member must attend the Maryland Association of Boards of Education new 
student board member orientation and all regular meetings of the board. The student 
member is a nonvoting board member and may not attend an executive session of the board. 
 
Current Law:  The Kent County Board of Education consists of five voting members. 
Although not codified in statute, there is currently a nonvoting student member that serves 
on the board. The Kent County Board of Education is one of 20 elected school boards in 
the State. There are also 4 hybrid boards in the State. The Appendix – Local Boards of 
Education Membership shows the selection methods, terms of office, and membership of 
the 24 local boards of education.

Appendix – Local Boards of Education Membership 
 
 
Membership 
 
The composition of the local boards of education varies with members serving three- to 
four-year terms. Twenty counties have elected school boards and four counties have 
combined appointed and elected school boards. Twenty-two boards have student members; 
however, only 8 boards allow student members to vote, which generally excludes authority 
to vote on matters relating to collective bargaining, personnel, and operating and capital 
budgets. Exhibit 1 shows the selection methods, terms of office, and membership of the 
24 local school boards.

HB 402/ Page 5 
1 E = Elected and A/E = Combined appointed by Governor and elected board, except (1) in Baltimore City, 
members are appointed by the mayor and (2) in Harford County, members are appointed by the county 
executive with the advice and consent of the county council. Entries for local boards that are at any point 
in the process of transitioning between means of selection reflect the final state the board will be in once 
the transition fully takes effect. 
 
2 Chapter 473 of 2017 restructured the Anne Arundel County Board of Education from a nine-member 
appointed board to an eight-member elected board consisting of seven elected members (one from each of 
the seven councilmanic districts on a nonpartisan basis) and one student member. The terms of the elected 
members are staggered; four members were elected at the 2018 general election and three members were 
elected at the 2020 general election as the terms of previously appointed board members expired. In this 
manner, the elected board is phased in. The members elected in 2018 serve a six-year term, while the 
members elected in 2020 serve a four-year term. Thus, beginning in 2024, all members must stand for 
election. An elected member of the board generally serves a four-year term beginning on the first Monday 
in December after the member’s election and until a successor is elected and qualifies. 
 
3 Chapter 593 of 2017 repealed the role of the Governor in making appointments to the Baltimore City 
Board of School Commissioners; it also repealed the Governor’s role in filling board vacancies and 
removing board members. As a result, board members are appointed solely by the Mayor of Baltimore City 
until the appointed/elected board established by the legislation is executed at the 2022 general election. 
Chapter 593 also established the Baltimore City Public School Board Community Panel (which the mayor 
must convene) and specified its membership. The purpose of the panel is to select nominees to be 
recommended to the mayor as qualified candidates for appointment to the board, including candidates for 
vacancies. If the mayor chooses not to appoint a member or to fill a vacancy from a list submitted by the 
panel, the mayor must reconvene the panel to submit additional names of qualified candidates. Beginning 
with the 2022 general election, the board will be restructured as a hybrid board with two members elected 
from the city at large, nine members appointed by the mayor, and one student member. Elected members 
will serve a four-year term and appointed members will serve a three-year term. 
 
4 Chapters 404 and 405 of 2021 added two new members to the Charles County Board of Education and 
altered the selection method for board members by requiring that eight board members be elected from the 
county commissioner districts (two from each of the four districts) and one board member be elected from 
the county at large. Previously, the seven board members were all elected from the county at large. All seats 
are subject to election in November 2022; however, the at-large member elected in November 2022 must 
serve a two-year term (instead of the usual four-year term) until a successor is elected to a full term in 
November 2024. Chapters 404 and 405 also provided the student member with voting rights, subject to 
certain restrictions. 
 
5 Chapter 569 of 2022 eliminated the role of the Governor in appointing members to the Harford County 
Board of Education. Instead, beginning with members appointed following the 2022 gubernatorial election, 
the Harford County Executive will appoint board members, subject to the advice and consent of the 
Harford County Council by a vote of at least five members. In appointing members to the board, the county 
executive must ensure, to the extent practicable, that the total makeup of the board reflects the gender, 
ethnic, and racial diversity of the county. Members appointed to the board following the 2022 election must 
serve for a term of two years until a successor is appointed and qualifies. Subsequent board members will 
be appointed following the 2024 presidential election and each presidential election thereafter. 
 
6 Although not in statute, the Kent County Board of Education reports that there is a nonvoting student 
member of the board and that the student member does not attend closed sessions.

7 Chapter 217 of 2022 altered the membership of the Prince George’s County Board of Education by 
removing the four appointed members from the board. Effective July 1, 2024, the board will become an 
elected board that consists of nine elected members, each of whom must reside in and be elected from a 
different school board district, and one student member. 
 
8 Although not in statute, the Washington County Board of Education reports that there is a student member 
on the board and that the student member can only concur on votes and must abstain from certain matters.
