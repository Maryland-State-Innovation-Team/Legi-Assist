Bill Summary/Current Law:   
 
Law Enforcement Officers – Procedures and Requirements Regarding a Suspected Child 
Victim of Sex Trafficking or Human Trafficking 
 
Under current law, in addition to compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of 
child abuse and neglect, a law enforcement officer who has reason to believe that a child 
who has been detained is a victim of sex trafficking must notify any appropriate regional 
navigator for the jurisdiction where the child was taken into custody or where the child is 
a resident that the child is a suspected victim of sex trafficking. 
 
The bill extends the notification requirement to suspected victims of human trafficking and 
specifies that the notification must be made as soon as practicable so the regional navigator 
can coordinate a service response. The bill also requires (as soon as practicable), the law 
enforcement officer to (1) report to the local child welfare agency that the child is a 
suspected victim of sex trafficking or human trafficking and (2) release the child to the 
child’s parents, guardian, or custodian if it is safe and appropriate to do so, or to the local 
child welfare agency if there is reason to believe that the child’s safety will be at risk if the 
child is returned to the parent, guardian, or custodian. 
 
Under current law, a law enforcement officer or other person authorized by the court may 
take a child into custody if the officer/person has reasonable grounds to believe that the 
child is in immediate danger from the child’s surroundings and that the child’s removal is 
necessary for the child’s protection. 
 
Under the bill, a law enforcement officer who takes a child who is a suspected victim of 
sex trafficking or human trafficking into custody under this provision may not detain the 
child in a juvenile detention facility if the reason for detaining the child is a suspected 
violation of a qualifying offense or § 3‐1102 of the Criminal Law Article. 
 
Court Procedures – Required Determinations and Dismissals 
 
The bill also establishes that at any time after a petition alleging that a child has committed 
a qualifying offense, a violation, or an offense under § 3‐1102 of the Criminal Law Article 
has been filed with the juvenile court, the court, on its own motion or on motion of the 
child’s counsel or the State’s Attorney, must (1) make a specified determination (described 
below); (2) stay all proceedings until the determination is made; and (3) refer the child to 
a regional navigator and notify the Department of Human Services (DHS). The court must 
schedule a hearing within 15 days after a motion is filed and may, on good cause shown, 
extend the time for the hearing by an additional 15 days.

The court must determine – by evidence presented on the record and by a preponderance 
of the evidence – whether the child (1) is a victim of sex trafficking or human trafficking 
and (2) committed the qualifying offense, violation, or offense under § 3‐1102 of the 
Criminal Law Article as a direct result of being a victim of sex trafficking or human 
trafficking. If the court finds that the child is a victim of sex trafficking or human trafficking 
and committed the underlying act as a direct result of being such a victim, the court must 
dismiss the charge for any qualifying offense, violation, or offense under § 3-1102 of the 
Criminal Law Article.

The bill adds the offenses of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle under § 14‐102 of the 
Transportation Article and soliciting or offering to solicit prostitution or assignation under 
§ 11-306 of the Criminal Law Article to the list of qualifying offenses under this statute. 
 
Under current law, a person convicted of a qualifying offense may file a motion to vacate 
the judgment if the person’s participation in the offense was a direct result of being a victim 
of human trafficking. Specific procedural requirements apply to these motions, and a 
conviction that has been vacated under these provisions may not be considered a conviction 
for any purpose. Pursuant to Chapters 126 and 127 of 2020, a person who was convicted 
of a crime and has the conviction vacated under § 8-302 of the Criminal Procedure Article 
is eligible to file a petition to expunge records regarding the vacated conviction under 
§ 10-105(a)(13) of the Criminal Procedure Article.

HB 297/ Page 5 
DHS must annually report to the Governor and the General Assembly on the number of 
reports of child sex trafficking made in the State in the preceding year; the outcome or 
disposition of reports of child sex trafficking made in the State in the preceding year; and 
the number of referrals made to regional navigators in the preceding year. According to its 
most recent report, during calendar 2021, Child Protective Services (CPS) investigated 
94 reports of alleged child sex trafficking. Of these reports, 32 were indicated (a finding 
that there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that physical or 
sexual abuse, or neglect did occur), 15 were unsubstantiated (a finding that there is an 
insufficient amount of evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out), and 47 were 
ruled out (a finding that physical or sexual abuse, or neglect did not occur). Law 
enforcement and local departments of social services made 91 referrals to regional 
navigators during calendar 2021. 
 
According to the University of Maryland SAFE Center for Human Trafficking Survivors, 
between June 2013 and April 2020, over 671 reports of suspected child sex trafficking were 
reported to and screened in by CPS units in Maryland’s 24 local departments of social 
services agencies. The center also reports that 110 youths were arrested for prostitution and 
commercialized vice in Maryland between 2010 and 2020, including 33 arrests of 
individuals ages 15 or younger.
