Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Since the adoption of the Maryland State Flag in 1904 and the adoption of 
the Black-eyed Susan as the State flower in 1918, the State has adopted many official 
symbols, as shown in Exhibit 1. The Governor is also authorized to designate a citizen as 
the State’s Poet Laureate.
