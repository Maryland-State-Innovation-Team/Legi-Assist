 
Class G (trailer); 
 
Class H (school bus); and 
 
Class P (passenger bus). 
 
For the purpose of determining the penalty under the bill, each day of a violation is 
considered a separate offense. Additionally, in the case of a combination tractor and trailer, 
a person who violates the bill is subject to a separate fine for each vehicle.  
 
Current Law:  The Maryland Vehicle Law governs the stopping, standing, and parking of 
vehicles, with various restrictions applicable under certain circumstances or within certain 
jurisdictions. A local authority, in the reasonable exercise of its police power, may also 
regulate or prohibit the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles on highways within its 
jurisdiction. Generally, a violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law is a misdemeanor that 
carries a fine of up to $500. The amount of the prepaid fine for a violation of most 
provisions regulating stopping, standing, or parking is generally $50, $60, or $70, 
depending on the specific violation.
