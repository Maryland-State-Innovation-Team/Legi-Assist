Local Fiscal Effect:  The St. Mary’s County transfer tax rate is set at 1%. The county will 
collect approximately $11.0 million in local transfer tax revenues in fiscal 2023. Transfer 
tax revenues are allocated to the county capital improvement fund, which provides funding 
for various capital improvement projects. The St. Mary’s County capital budget for 
fiscal 2023 includes $68.8 million in total funding, of which 16.0% comes from the local 
transfer tax. 
 
Pursuant to the bill, St. Mary’s County transfer tax revenues will continue to be collected 
through September 2028. The county capital budget for fiscal 2023 assumes approximately 
$8.0 million in transfer tax revenues through fiscal 2028. Due to the bill’s 
October 1, 2028 termination date, it is estimated that transfer tax revenues will total 
approximately $2.0 million in fiscal 2029 reflecting three months of collections.
