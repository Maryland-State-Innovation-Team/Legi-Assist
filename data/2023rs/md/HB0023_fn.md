Bill Summary:   
 
Mobile Home Parks – Relocation Plans 
 
The bill alters statutory provisions that specify certain requirements when residents of a 
mobile home park are to be relocated due to a change in the land use of a park. Specifically, 
the bill alters the calculation for relocation assistance if a mobile home park is to be closed 
and establishes that such assistance is owed if a park with more than 10 sites is closed 
(under current law, this requirement is triggered when a park with more than 38 sites is 
closed). The bill requires the owner to pay each household relocation assistance that equals 
the amount of rent for the premises, excluding taxes and utilities, paid for the 12 months 
(rather than 10 months, as under current law) immediately preceding the date the resident 
vacates the premises. The bill makes a conforming change to provisions regarding a 
required relocation plan. 
 
Sale of Manufactured Housing Communities – Select Definitions and Applicability 
 
A “manufactured housing community” means any property leased or held out for lease to 
two or more owners of manufactured homes for residential use; a manufactured housing 
community includes a “park.” 
 
A “homeowners organization” means an incorporated or unincorporated organization, 
including a cooperative housing corporation, that (1) represents the interests of the 
homeowners in an MHC; (2) is open to all homeowners residing in the MHC; (3) is 
controlled by the members of the organization; and (4) is comprised of homeowners who 
lease or rent at least 75% of lots in the MHC. 
 
The bill’s requirements related to the sale of an MHC apply separately to each substantially 
different offer to sell or to purchase an MHC. However, the bill’s requirements do not apply 
to the potential sale of an MHC if:   
 
 
a mortgagee, grantee, or other secured party has foreclosed on the MHC and the 
mortgagee, grantee, or secured party is selling the MHC at a foreclosure sale or after 
purchasing the MHC at a foreclosure sale; 
 
the community owner is selling the MHC to (1) a family member of the community 
owner or (2) a trust whose beneficiaries are family members of the community 
owner;

HB 23/ Page 3 
 
the community owner is a partnership, limited liability company, or similar business 
entity and the sale is to one or more of the partners or members of the business 
entity; 
 
the conveyance of an interest in the MHC is incidental to the financing of the MHC; 
 
the sale of the MHC is between joint tenants or tenants in common; 
 
the sale of the MHC is a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain; 
 
the sale of the MHC involves a merger, recapitalization, or similar transaction where 
(1) at least one community owner prior to the transaction remains a community 
owner after the transaction and (2) the community owner files an affidavit, recorded 
in the land records in the county in which the property is located, affirming that the 
community owner will allow continued use of the land as an MHC for at least 
six months after the date the transaction is finalized; or 
 
the sale of the MHC involves a like‐kind exchange or a sale of more than one home 
in the community to a single purchaser. 
 
Sale Requirements 
 
If an offer to purchase an MHC is tendered to a community owner, acceptance of the offer 
must be conditioned on the purchaser filing an affidavit, recorded in the land records of the 
appropriate county, affirming that (1) the purchaser will allow continued use of the land as 
an MHC for five years after the date the purchase is finalized and (2) rent for a lot on the 
property will not increase by more than 10% per year for the first three years after the date 
the purchase is finalized. 
 
However, if the purchaser fails to file an affidavit in accordance with the provisions above, 
acceptance of the offer must be conditioned on the community owner (1) providing notice 
of the terms of the offer or contract to each homeowner in the community, DHCD, and the 
appropriate housing agency and (2) providing the homeowners with an opportunity to 
purchase the MHC, in accordance with the bill. 
 
The notice by the community owner must be posted in a public area of the community and 
sent by registered or certified mail to the homeowners organization. The notice must 
include (1) the price and material terms and conditions of the offer that the community 
owner conditionally accepted for the sale of the MHC, as specified; (2) a specific statement 
related to the opportunity the homeowners hold to purchase the community, including that 
any offer must be submitted within 60 days of the mailing date of the notice and contain 
substantially similar material terms to the offer that the community owner has conditionally 
accepted; and (3) the list of organizations and county housing agencies that provide 
assistance for financing, as specified.

HB 23/ Page 4 
The price and terms and conditions stated in the notice to the homeowners must be 
universal and applicable to all potential buyers and not specific to the homeowners or their 
assignee. Within 10 days after the date on which the community owner provides notice, 
the community owner must make available to the homeowners organization the same 
information that the owner provided or would have provided to other prospective 
purchasers. The community owner is not liable to any party to a real estate transaction for 
a violation of specified provisions under the bill. 
 
A homeowners organization may offer to purchase the MHC by (1) providing documentation 
to the community owner that at least 75% of the members of the homeowners organization 
who reside in the MHC, with one vote per home, have voted to purchase the community; 
(2) notifying the community owner of the intent to purchase the MHC; and (3) submitting 
to the community owner a proposed agreement to purchase the MHC that includes terms 
substantially similar to the terms included in the aforementioned sales notice. The 
homeowners organization must send the notice of intent to purchase and the proposed 
agreement by registered or certified mail. 
 
If the homeowners organization submits a proposed agreement within the 60‐day period 
(that meets the specified requirements) to purchase the MHC, the community owner must 
consider the offer from the homeowners organization in good faith. This includes a duty 
not to act to (1) scuttle the proposed agreement; (2) arbitrarily or capriciously refuse to 
proceed with negotiations; and (3) engage in misconduct or dishonesty in the negotiations. 
After the expiration of the 60‐day period, the community owner may not be required to 
consider additional offers from the homeowners organization.  
 
If the community owner and the homeowners organization enter into an agreement for the 
sale of the MHC, unless the parties agree to an alternative period of time, the homeowners 
organization must have no more than 105 days after the date of the agreement to obtain 
financing and close the purchase. However, if the homeowners organization does not 
obtain financing for the purchase or the parties fail to close on the purchase within the time 
period prescribed above, the community owner has satisfied the obligation. 
 
For the purpose of continuing the use of the property as an MHC that will provide 
affordable housing, the homeowners organization is authorized to assign its rights under 
the bill to a local government, housing authority, nonprofit (with expertise related to 
housing), the State, or an agency of the State. 
 
Compliance and Civil Remedies 
 
If a community owner willfully fails to comply with the requirements of the bill, the 
community owner is liable to the homeowners organization in the amount of $10,000.

HB 23/ Page 5 
A purchaser or community owner who files an affidavit in the land records regarding the 
continued use of the land as an MHC, as specified above, must – no more than 30 days 
after the date of the sale – provide notice of the affidavit to each homeowner by 
first-class mail and post a copy of the affidavit in a public area of the MHC. A purchaser 
who files an affidavit as required under the bill is liable to the homeowners organization in 
the amount of $10,000 if the purchaser (1) closes the MHC within five years after the date 
the purchase is finalized or (2) increases the rent for a lot on the property by more than 
10% per year in the first three years after the date the purchase is finalized. 
 
Current Law:  “Manufactured home” means a structure that is (1) transportable in one or 
more sections; (2) 8 body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length in 
traveling mode, or is more than 320 square feet when erected on site; (3) built on a 
permanent chassis; and (4) designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent 
foundation when connected to the required utilities.  
 
Under Title 8A of the Real Property Article (Mobile Home Parks) “park” means any 
property leased or held out for lease to two or more residents or prospective residents. 
 
State/Local Fiscal Effect:  Although DHCD and housing agencies are tasked with 
receiving required notices, the bill does not impose any other specific responsibilities on 
the agencies regarding those notices. For purposes of this fiscal and policy note, it is 
assumed that DHCD and housing agencies can establish a process to receive notices using 
existing resources, but are not required to take any further action (e.g., 
enforcement/monitoring activities, etc.), beyond maintaining the notices. It is also assumed 
that DHCD can develop and maintain on its website a required list of organizations and 
county housing agencies available to assist homeowners with financing for the purchase of 
an MHC with existing resources. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Among other impacts, small business owners of MHCs that are 
not otherwise exempt are subject to more stringent requirements when selling an MHC, 
which may impact expenditures and delay revenues associated with the sale. Certain 
purchasers of MHCs and owners of mobile home parks are also subject to additional 
requirements and restrictions.
