Designers within the Maryland Department of Labor (MDL) by 10 years to July 1, 2034. 
   
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Special fund revenues and expenditures for the board are maintained from 
FY 2025 through 2034. 
  
Local Effect:  None.  
  
Small Business Effect:  MDL has determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on

Analysis 
 
Current Law/Background:  The State Board of Certified Interior Designers certifies and 
regulates certified interior designers. The board also investigates complaints against 
certified interior designers and may issue a reprimand, suspend or revoke a certification, 
or impose a fine. MDL advises the board represents a growing profession in the State. 
 
The board is 1 of approximately 60 regulatory entities and activities subject to termination 
unless reauthorized periodically through statute. Under the Maryland Program Evaluation 
Act, these entities may also be subject to an evaluation by the Office of Program Evaluation 
and Government Accountability (OPEGA) within DLS prior to their termination.

However, OPEGA may conduct an evaluation only if directed by specified entities or by 
legislation. The board is scheduled to terminate July 1, 2024; OPEGA was not asked to 
conduct an evaluation prior to its termination. Accordingly, the board has requested 
reauthorizing legislation.
