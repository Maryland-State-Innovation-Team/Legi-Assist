Analysis 
 
Current Law:  Chapter 34 of 2016 established the Construction Education and Innovation 
Fund to support MCCEI. MCCEI is a public-private partnership located at 
Towson University that was established in 2010. It resulted from work performed by the 
Center for Industry Initiatives for Construction of the Governor’s Workforce Investment 
Board (GWIB), which had convened a forum of industry stakeholders. GWIB provided 
MCCEI with grant funding of $225,000 in each of fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015, but GWIB 
ended its support for MCCEI afterward. Chapter 34 continued State support of MCCEI by 
mandating $250,000 annually for the fund.
