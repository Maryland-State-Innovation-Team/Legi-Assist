Judicial Proceedings 
 
Public Safety - Regulated Firearms - Possession and Permits to Carry, Wear, and 
Transport a Handgun 
 
 
This bill (1) increases the maximum incarceration penalty for violations of the prohibition 
against wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, as specified; (2) modifies and 
expands an existing prohibition relating to the possession of a regulated firearm; and  
(3) modifies and expands the requirements and procedures relating to the issuance and 
renewal of a permit to carry, wear, and transport a handgun (handgun permit); it also 
increases the maximum handgun permit fees. In addition, the bill (1) requires the Secretary 
of State Police, in consultation with other specified State agencies, to develop, publish, 
update, and distribute a specified curriculum to all State-certified firearms instructors;  
(2) requires the Department of State Police (DSP) to transmit a summary of new and 
changed laws relating to firearms to specified e-mail addresses; and (3) establishes various 
reporting requirements. Specified provisions do not apply to handgun permits issued before 
October 1, 2023 (the bill’s effective date) until the handgun permit is subject to renewal.  
  
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Under one set of assumptions, general fund revenues from handgun permit 
fees increase by an estimated $5.3 million in FY 2024. Future year revenue estimates 
reflect the permit issuance and renewal cycle and a decrease in new permit applications 
and renewals over time. General fund expenditures increase by at least $2.4 million in 
FY 2024; future year expenditures reflect annualization, inflation, and ongoing costs. 
Minimal increase in general fund revenues and expenditures due to the application of 
existing penalty provisions and the increase in a maximum incarceration penalty.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary: 
 
Prohibition on Wearing, Carrying, or Transporting a Firearm 
 
This bill increases the maximum incarceration penalty, from three years to five years, that 
may be imposed on a violator of the prohibition against wearing, carrying, or transporting 
a handgun when the person has no prior convictions under §§ 4-203 (wearing, carrying, or 
transporting a handgun), 4-204 (use of a handgun or antique firearm in the commission of 
a crime), 4-101 (wearing or carrying dangerous weapons), or 4-102 (deadly weapons on 
school property) of the Criminal Law Article. 
 
Possession of a Regulated Firearm 
 
Disqualifiers:  A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person is on supervised 
probation after being convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or 
more, for a violation of § 21-902(b) or (c) of the Transportation Article (driving while 
under the influence or driving while impaired), or for violating a protective order under  
§ 4-509 of the Family Law Article (failure to comply with interim or final protective order). 
This provision may not be construed to prohibit possession of a regulated firearm by a 
person who was not convicted of but received only probation before judgment for an 
offense listed above. 
 
Permit to Carry, Wear, or Transport a Handgun 
 
Fees:  The bill increases the maximum fee for (1) an initial application for a handgun permit 
(from $75 to $125); (2) a renewal or subsequent application for a handgun permit (from 
$50 to $75); and (3) a duplicate or modified handgun permit (from $10 to $20). 
 
Qualifications:  With exceptions, the bill modifies the qualifications for a handgun permit 
to require, in addition to current law, that a person:  
 
 
is at least age 21 (increased from an adult (age 18) under current law) or is a person 
who is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, the National Guard, or the uniformed 
services;  

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
HB 824/ Page 3 
 
is not on supervised probation for a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year 
or more, for a violation of § 21-902(b) or (c) of the Transportation Article (driving 
while under the influence or driving while impaired), or for violating a protective 
order under § 4-509 of the Family Law Article (failure to comply with interim or 
final protective order);  
 
does not suffer from a mental disorder and have a history of violent behavior against 
the person or another; 
 
has not been involuntarily admitted for more than 30 consecutive days to a facility 
that provides treatment or other services for mental disorders; and 
 
is not a respondent against whom a current non ex parte civil protective order has 
been entered under § 4-506 of the Family Law Article, a current extreme risk 
protective order has been entered under § 5-601 of the Public Safety Article, or any 
other type of current court order has been entered prohibiting the person from 
purchasing or possessing firearms.  
 
Firearms Training Course:  The bill modifies the requirements for a firearms training 
course approved by the Secretary of State Police to require in-person instruction by a 
qualified handgun instructor and to include classroom instruction on: 
 
 
State and federal firearm laws, including laws relating to (1) self-defense law;  
(2) defense of others and property; (3) the safe storage of firearms; (4) the 
circumstances under which an individual becomes prohibited from possessing a 
firearm under State and federal law, as specified; (5) the requirements and options 
for surrendering, transferring, or otherwise disposing of a firearm after becoming 
prohibited from possessing a firearm under State or federal law; (6) the requirements 
for reporting a loss or theft of a firearm to a law enforcement agency, as specified; 
(7) the firearms and firearm accessories which are banned under State and federal 
law; (8) the types of firearms that require a special permit or registration to acquire 
or possess under State or federal law; (9) the law prohibiting straw purchases and 
the law concerning armed trespass, as specified; and (10) the locations where a 
person is prohibited from possessing a firearm regardless of whether the person 
possesses a handgun permit; 
 
home firearm safety (required under current law); 
 
handgun mechanisms and operations (required under current law); 
 
conflict de-escalation and resolutions; 
 
anger management; and 
 
suicide prevention.  
 
In addition, the firearms training course must include a firearm qualification component 
that includes live-fire shooting exercises on a firing range and requires the applicant to 
demonstrate safe handling of a handgun and shooting proficiency with a handgun (rather 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
HB 824/ Page 4 
than the current law requirement for a firearms qualification component that demonstrates 
the applicant’s proficiency and use of the firearm).  
 
The Secretary of State Police, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General 
(OAG) and the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), must develop, publish, update, 
and distribute to all State-certified firearms instructors a curriculum of instruction for the 
topics required for classroom instruction as discussed above. 
 
Investigation:  For a handgun permit to be issued, the bill requires that, based on an 
investigation, the person is not otherwise prohibited by State or federal law from 
purchasing or possessing a handgun (rather than the current law requirement that, based on 
an investigation, the person has good and substantial reason to wear, carry, or transport a 
handgun, such as a finding that the permit is necessary as a reasonable precaution against 
apprehended danger). 
 
Prohibition:  The Secretary of State Police may not issue a handgun permit to a person if 
the person has been convicted, on or after October 1, 2023, of a second or subsequent 
violation of § 4-104 of the Criminal Law Article (access to firearms by a child) or has been 
convicted, on or after October 1, 2023, of a violation of § 4-104 of the Criminal Law Article 
if the violation resulted in the use of a loaded firearm by a minor causing death or serious 
bodily injury to the minor or another person. The Secretary may not issue a permit to a 
person who has been convicted, on or after October 1, 2023, of a first violation of § 4-104 
of the Criminal Law Article for five years following the date of the conviction. 
 
Revocation:  The Secretary of State Police is required (rather than authorized) to revoke a 
handgun permit on a finding that the person does not meet the qualifications for issuance 
of handgun permit. The Secretary must regularly review information regarding active 
permit holders using the Criminal Justice Information System Central Repository of the 
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) to determine whether all 
permit holders continue to meet the qualifications for issuance of a handgun permit. If the 
Secretary revokes a permit under these provisions from a person the Secretary determines 
is prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm, the Secretary must take reasonable steps 
to ensure the surrender of any regulated firearms in the person’s possession. 
 
Written Notice:  If the Secretary denies a permit or renewal of a permit or revokes or limits 
a permit, the Secretary must provide written notice of that initial action to the applicant, 
including a detailed explanation of the reason or reasons for the initial action. In addition, 
a written notice of the results of an informal review by the Secretary of a permit denial, 
permit renewal denial, permit revocation, or limiting of a handgun permit must include a 
detailed explanation of the reason or reasons for the Secretary’s decision to sustain, reverse, 
or modify the initial action. With respect to a person who appeals a decision of the 
Secretary to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), the bill specifies that the finding 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 824/ Page 5 
of facts that OAH must issue within 90 days after the conclusion of the last hearing on the 
matter must be in writing.  
 
E-mail Summaries of New and Changed Laws Pertaining to Firearms:  DSP must transmit 
a summary of each new law or change to each existing law pertaining to firearms that was 
passed by the General Assembly during each legislative session to each e-mail address on 
file with the department that is associated with (1) the purchaser or transferee of a regulated 
firearm or (2) a person who has registered a regulated firearm with the department. The 
summary must be transmitted (1) within 45 days after the General Assembly adjourns 
Sine Die in a legislative session; (2) 30 days before the effective date of the act, for each 
act establishing a new law or change to an existing law pertaining to firearms; and (3) as 
soon as practicable if an act is designated as an emergency act.   
 
Required Reports:  By January 1 each year, OAH must report to the Governor and the 
General Assembly on the following items, disaggregated by an applicant’s county of 
residence, race, ethnicity, age, and gender:  
 
 
the number of appeals of decisions by the Secretary that have been filed with OAH 
within the previous year; 
 
the number of appeals of decisions by the Secretary that have been sustained, 
modified, or reversed by OAH within the previous year; 
 
the number of appeals that are pending; and 
 
the number of appeals that have been withdrawn within the previous year. 
 
By January 1 each year, the Secretary of State Police must report to the Governor and the 
General Assembly the following information disaggregated by an applicant’s county of 
residence, race, ethnicity, age, and gender: 
 
 
the total number of permit applications that were submitted to the Secretary within 
the previous year; 
 
the total number of permit applications that were granted, denied, and revoked 
within the previous year; and 
 
the total number of permit applications filed with the Secretary that are pending at 
the time of the issuance of the report. 
 
By October 1, 2024, and each October 1 thereafter, the Maryland State Commission on 
Criminal Sentencing Policy (MSCCSP) must report to the Governor and the 
General Assembly on the number of charges, convictions, and sentences for violations of 
§ 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article (wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun) and 
§ 5-133(d) of the Public Safety Article (restrictions on possession of regulated firearms by 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 824/ Page 6 
a person younger than age 21). The information included in the report must be 
disaggregated by jurisdiction, race, and gender.  
 
Current Law:  
 
Access to a Firearm:  A person may not store or leave a loaded firearm in a location where 
the person knew or should have known that an unsupervised child (defined as an individual 
younger than age 16) would gain access to the firearm. A violator is guilty of a 
misdemeanor and subject to a maximum fine of $1,000. 
 
The prohibition does not apply if: 
 
 
the child’s access to a firearm is supervised by an individual at least age 18; 
 
the child’s access to a firearm was obtained as a result of an unlawful entry; 
 
the firearm is in the possession or control of a law enforcement officer while the 
officer is engaged in official duties; or 
 
the child has a certificate of firearm and hunter safety issued under applicable 
provisions of the Natural Resources Article. 
 
A violation may not (1) be considered evidence of negligence; (2) be considered evidence 
of contributory negligence; (3) limit liability of a party or an insurer; or (4) diminish 
recovery for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a firearm 
or ammunition. A party, witness, or lawyer may not refer to a violation during a trial of a 
civil action that involves property damage, personal injury, or death.  
 
Prohibitions on Possession:  Generally, a person is prohibited from possessing regulated 
firearms, rifles, and shotguns if the person: 
 
 
has been convicted of a disqualifying crime; 
 
has been convicted of a violation classified as a common law crime and received a 
term of imprisonment of more than two years; 
 
is a fugitive from justice; 
 
is a habitual drunkard; 
 
is addicted to a controlled dangerous substance or is a habitual user; 
 
suffers from a mental disorder and has a history of violent behavior against the 
person or another; 
 
has been found incompetent to stand trial; 
 
has been found not criminally responsible; 
 
has been voluntarily admitted for more than 30 consecutive days to a facility that 
provides treatment or other services for mental disorders; 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 824/ Page 7 
 
has been involuntarily committed to a facility that provides treatment or other 
services for mental disorders; 
 
is under the protection of a guardian of the person or property of a disabled person 
appointed by a court, except for cases in which the appointment of a guardian is 
solely a result of a physical disability; 
 
is a respondent against whom a current non ex parte civil protective order has been 
entered in this State or an order for protection has been issued by a court of another 
state or a Native American tribe and is in effect; or 
 
if younger than age 30 at the time of possession, has been adjudicated delinquent by 
a juvenile court for an act that would be a disqualifying crime if committed by an 
adult. 
 
In addition, a person is prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm if the person was 
previously convicted of (1) a crime of violence; (2) a violation of specified controlled 
dangerous substances laws; or (3) an offense under the laws of another state or the 
United States that would constitute one of these crimes if committed in this State. 
 
Generally, prohibited possession of a regulated firearm is a misdemeanor and subject to 
maximum penalties of five years imprisonment and/or $10,000 fine. However, prohibited 
possession of a rifle or shotgun is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to 
three years and/or a $1,000 maximum fine. 
 
Handgun Permit:  With specified exceptions, including possession of a handgun permit, a 
person may not (1) wear, carry, or transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or 
about the person; (2) wear, carry, or knowingly transport a handgun, whether concealed or 
open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public, highway, 
waterway, or airway of the State; (3) violate items (1) or (2) listed above while on public 
school property in the State; (4) violate items (1) or (2) listed above with the deliberate 
purpose of injuring or killing another person; or (5) violate items (1) or (2) listed above 
with a handgun loaded with ammunition. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person 
who transports a handgun does so knowingly. A violator is guilty of a misdemeanor and 
subject to the penalties listed below. The subsequent offender provisions apply to previous 
convictions under § 4-203 (wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun), § 4-204 (use of 
a handgun or antique firearm in the commission of a crime), § 4-101 (dangerous weapons), 
and § 4-102 (deadly weapons on school property) of the Criminal Law Article, as shown 
in Exhibit 1.

HB 824/ Page 9 
Existing statutory requirements and background relating to the issuance of handgun permits 
are summarized in the Appendix – Handgun Permit Requirements – Current 
Law/Background. 
 
State Revenues:  In 2020, DSP received 11,512 initial handgun permit applications and 
4,886 renewal applications; in 2021, 12,189 initial applications and 6,242 renewals; and in 
2022, 85,266 initial applications and 8,891 renewals. Since being directed on July 5, 2022, 
by then Governor Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr., to immediately stop using the “good and 
substantial reason” requirement when reviewing handgun permits in the State, DSP has 
received a record number of initial handgun permit applications. DSP advises that the 
demand for handgun permits under current law likely remains stable through fiscal 2025 
and then decreases by 50% in fiscal 2026, decreases by another 50% in fiscal 2027, and 
then remains stable at the reduced level.  
 
Under one set of assumptions, general fund revenues from handgun permit fees increase 
by an estimated $5.3 million in fiscal 2024 due to the increase in permit fees, which reflects 
the bill’s October 1, 2023 effective date. Exhibit 2 shows the estimated increase in fee 
revenues from fiscal 2024 through 2028. Generally, the estimate assumes that under both 
current law and the bill, there will be approximately 100,000 new permit applications in 
fiscal 2024 and 2025, 50,000 new permit applications in fiscal 2026, and 25,000 new 
permit applications in fiscal 2027 and 2028. The estimate reflects an increase in fee revenue 
from both initial permit applications and permit renewals and generally assumes that the 
total number of permits renewed decreases by 10% annually.

This estimate does not reflect any decrease in the number of permit applications (and 
subsequent renewals) that may result from the bill’s fee increases or changes to provisions 
governing the disqualifiers for obtaining a handgun permit; any such decrease cannot be

START OF PAGE 10

predicted without actual experience under the bill. This estimate also does not include any 
additional increase in fee revenue that may result from an increase in the fee for the 
issuance of a duplicate or modified handgun permit (from $10 to $20); sufficient data is 
not available regarding such issuances. Accordingly, the actual increase in fee revenue will 
vary from the estimate provided in this analysis depending on the actual number of permits 
issued and renewed each year. 
 
In addition, general fund revenues may increase minimally as a result of the bill’s alteration 
of prohibitions relating to possession of a regulated firearm and the application of existing 
monetary penalties from cases heard in the District Court. 
 
State Expenditures:  General fund expenditures increase by at least $2.4 million in 
fiscal 2024, which accounts for the bill’s October 1, 2023 effective date. Future year 
expenditures are annualized and reflect inflation and ongoing costs. 
 
Department of State Police 
 
Since former Governor Hogan’s directive in July 2022, overtime costs for DSP’s licensing 
division have increased significantly. The fiscal 2024 budget as passed by the 
General Assembly includes $22.2 million in general funds for the licensing division, an 
increase of approximately $4.3 million over the fiscal 2023 budget, reflecting additional 
staff to address the increase in workload stemming from the Governor’s directive. 
Nevertheless, existing staff cannot handle any increase in workload resulting from the bill. 
 
Accordingly, general fund expenditures for DSP increase by at least $2.3 million in 
fiscal 2024, which accounts for the bill’s October 1, 2023 effective date. This estimate 
reflects the cost of hiring 18 administrative specialists, 3 management specialists, and 
5 troopers to handle the bill’s requirements to regularly review information relating to 
active permit holders. It includes salaries, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs (including 
computer programming and the purchase of vehicles), and ongoing operating expenses.

This estimate does not include costs for additional police equipment for new troopers, 
initial training of new troopers, or vehicle maintenance. It also does not include costs for 
any rental space needed to accommodate the new employees. Accordingly, DSP 
expenditures are likely significantly higher than the estimate provided above. 
 
Maryland State Commission on Criminal Sentencing Policy 
 
General fund expenditures for MSCCSP increase by $90,455 in fiscal 2024, which 
accounts for the bill’s October 1, 2023 effective date. This estimate reflects the cost of 
hiring a researcher to complete the report relating to the number of charges, convictions, 
and sentences as required by the bill as MSCCSP does not currently collect data for charges 
or for convictions and sentencings occurring in District Court. It includes a salary, fringe 
benefits, one-time start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses.

Although the bill requires MSCCSP to submit its first report by October 1, 2024, MSCCSP 
needs additional staff beginning in fiscal 2024 in order to begin the process of obtaining, 
organizing, managing, and analyzing the required data for the report. Future year 
expenditures reflect a full salary with annual increases and employee turnover as well as 
annual increases in ongoing operating expenses. 
 
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services 
 
General fund expenditures for DPSCS increase minimally as a result of the bill’s increased 
incarceration penalty due to people being committed to State correctional facilities for 
longer periods of time and increased payments to counties for reimbursement of inmate 
costs. The number of people subject to lengthier sentences under the bill is assumed to be 
minimal. 
 
The Division of Corrections (DOC) conducted intake on 93 individuals for the applicable 
violations of § 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article during fiscal 2022; the average length of 
sentence for this group was 2.34 years. However, DOC did not indicate how many of these 
individuals were first-time offenders who would be subject to lengthier sentences under 
the bill.  
 
Persons serving a sentence longer than 18 months are incarcerated in State correctional 
facilities. Currently, the average total cost per inmate, including overhead, is estimated at 
$4,970 per month. Persons serving a sentence of one year or less in a jurisdiction other than

Baltimore City are sentenced to local detention facilities. For persons sentenced to a term 
of between 12 and 18 months, the sentencing judge has the discretion to order that the 
sentence be served at a local facility or a State correctional facility. The State provides 
assistance to the counties for locally sentenced inmates and for (1) inmates who are 
sentenced to and awaiting transfer to the State correctional system; (2) sentenced inmates 
confined in a local detention center between 12 and 18 months; and (3) inmates who have 
been sentenced to the custody of the State but are confined in or who receive reentry or 
other prerelease programming and services from a local facility.   
 
The State does not pay for pretrial detention time in a local correctional facility. Persons 
sentenced in Baltimore City are generally incarcerated in State correctional facilities. The 
Baltimore Pretrial Complex, a State-operated facility, is used primarily for pretrial 
detentions.  
 
Other State Agencies 
 
OAH, MDH, and the Judiciary can handle the bill’s changes with existing budgeted 
resources. Although OAG did not respond to requests for information regarding the fiscal 
effect of the bill, it is assumed that OAG can handle the bill’s changes using existing 
budgeted resources. 
 
Local Revenues:  Revenues increase minimally as a result of the application of existing 
monetary penalty provisions to violations of the bill. 
 
Local Expenditures:  Expenditures increase minimally as a result of the bill’s increased 
incarceration penalty. Counties pay the full cost of incarceration for people in their 
facilities for the first 12 months of the sentence. Per diem operating costs of local detention 
facilities have ranged from approximately $90 to $300 per inmate in recent years. 
 
Additional Comments:  The Judiciary advises that there were 304 guilty dispositions 
(convictions) in the District Court for violations of § 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article 
during fiscal 2022. Information is not readily available on how many of these convictions 
were for defendants who were first-time offenders. MSCCSP advises that, for fiscal 2022, 
it received information for 881 individuals sentenced in the circuit courts to 900 total 
counts of unlawful wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun as a first offense under  
§ 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article. Information is not readily available on how many of 
these individuals were also sentenced for more serious offenses.

Appendix 
Handgun Permit Requirements – Current Law/Background 
 
 
Generally, with certain exceptions, to be issued a handgun permit by the Secretary of State 
Police, an applicant (1) must be 18 or older; (2) must not have been convicted of a felony 
or misdemeanor for which a sentence of imprisonment for more than one year has been 
imposed or, if convicted, must have been pardoned or been granted relief under federal 
law; (3) must not have been convicted of a controlled dangerous substance violation and 
must not presently be an addict, a habitual user of a controlled dangerous substance, or an 
alcoholic; (4) must not exhibit a propensity for violence or instability, which may 
reasonably render possession of a handgun a danger to the applicant or another; (5) must have 
successfully completed, prior to application and each renewal, a specified firearms training 
course approved by the Secretary; (6) if younger than 30, must not have been committed 
to a facility for juveniles for longer than one year or adjudicated delinquent for a crime of 
violence, a felony, or misdemeanor that carries a statutory penalty of more than two years; 
and (7) must have a good and substantial reason to wear, carry, or transport a handgun. 
“Good and substantial reason” includes a finding that the permit is necessary as a 
reasonable precaution against apprehended danger. The Secretary may limit the geographic 
area, circumstances, or times of day, week, month, or year in which a permit is effective. 
 
A handgun permit applicant must successfully complete, prior to the application and each 
renewal, a firearms training course approved by the Secretary that includes (1) for an initial 
application, a minimum of 16 hours of instruction by a qualified handgun instructor, or 
8 hours of instruction for a renewal application; (2) classroom instruction on State firearm 
law, home firearm safety, and handgun mechanisms and operation; and (3) a firearms 
qualification component that demonstrates the applicant’s proficiency and use of the firearm. 
 
An applicant for a permit is not required to complete a certified firearms training course if 
the applicant: 
 
 
is a law enforcement officer or a person who is retired in good standing from service 
with a law enforcement agency of the United States, the State, or any local law 
enforcement agency in the State; 
 
is a member, retired member, or honorably discharged member of the 
U.S. Armed Forces or the National Guard; 
 
is a qualified handgun instructor; or 
 
has completed a firearms training course approved by the Secretary. 
 
A handgun permit application costs $75; two years after the initial permit and every 
three years thereafter, a $50 renewal fee is due. In addition, the applicant must pay for

fingerprint-based federal and State criminal history background checks for an initial 
application. A person who applies for a renewal of a handgun permit is not required to be 
fingerprinted unless the Secretary requires a set of the person’s fingerprints to resolve a 
question of the person’s identity. 
 
Generally, a handgun permit expires on the last day of the holder’s birth month following 
two years after the date the permit is issued; however, the Secretary may establish an 
alternative expiration date for a permit to coincide with the expiration of a private detective 
license, a security guard certification, or a special police officer commission. A permit may 
be renewed for successive periods of three years each if, at the time of an application for 
renewal, the applicant possesses the qualifications for the issuance of a permit and pays the 
renewal fee. 
 
On June 23, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, 
Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. (2022), held unconstitutional a New York law that required 
applicants for a concealed carry handgun permit to demonstrate a “proper cause” (or a 
special need for self-defense) before issuance of a license to carry a handgun in public. In 
a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Second Amendment provides 
a constitutionally protected right for a law-abiding citizen to carry a handgun outside the 
home for self-defense. 
 
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, Maryland’s Court of Special Appeals (now 
the Appellate Court of Maryland) applied Bruen directly to In the Matter of William 
Rounds, 255 Md. App. 205 (2022), ruling that Maryland’s wear and carry handgun permit 
law requiring an applicant to have a “good and substantial reason” to be issued a license to 
carry was analogous to New York’s “proper cause” requirement and was unconstitutional. 
On July 5, 2022, then Governor Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr., responded to the ruling by 
directing the Department of State Police (DSP) to immediately stop using the “good and 
substantial reason” requirement when reviewing handgun permits in the State. On 
July 6, 2022, OAG issued a similar letter advising on the constitutionality and severability 
of the “good and substantial reason” from the State’s handgun permit statute while 
affirming all other requirements for a handgun permit remain in effect. 
 
According to DSP, there has been a substantial increase in handgun permit applications in 
Maryland since the Bruen ruling. In 2022, DSP received 85,266 new applications for 
handgun permits (up from a total of 12,189 in 2021) and 8,891 handgun permit renewal 
applications. DSP denied 1,787 applications in the same year. As of January 20, 2023, there 
are approximately 113,964 active handgun permits in the State (up from 26,119 active 
handgun permits in the State at the end of 2021). It generally takes less than 2 days to 
receive the results of a national criminal history records check from the FBI and 
approximately 90 days to process, investigate, and issue a permit.
