Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 984 
(Delegate J. Lewis, et al.) 
Appropriations 
Finance and Education, Energy, and the 
Environment 
 
Public Employee Relations Act 
 
 
This bill substantially restructures the State’s rules, procedures, processes, rights, and 
prohibitions regarding collective bargaining by public employees. More specifically, the 
bill (1) consolidates different collective bargaining laws that apply for different employees 
into one set of rules and procedures for public employees; (2) repeals the State Labor 
Relations Board (SLRB), the State Higher Education Labor Relations Board (SHELRB), 
and the Public School Labor Relations Board (PSLRB), and instead establishes the Public 
Employee Relations Board (PERB) to oversee collective bargaining for all public 
employees; and (3) makes several significant and/or substantive changes to the existing 
collective bargaining processes and requirements. Provisions of the bill deemed invalid are 
severable. The bill takes effect July 1, 2023. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  General fund expenditures increase by at least $642,600 in FY 2024; future 
years reflect ongoing operating expenses and the elimination of one-time costs. Otherwise, 
the State may experience administrative efficiencies from the bill’s consolidations. 
Revenues are not directly affected.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Consolidation of Collective Bargaining Laws and Conforming and Technical Changes 
 
The bill consolidates many State laws governing collective bargaining for public 
employees (which include State, local, community college, and local board of education 
employees) into a new title within the State Government Article. The provisions are moved 
from the (1) Education Article, where the provisions apply to public university, community 
college, and local public school system employees; (2) Health-General Article, where the 
provisions apply for independent home care providers; and (3) State Personnel and 
Pensions and State Government articles, where the provisions apply to State employees 
generally. 
 
Consolidation of existing provisions generally results in rules, processes, and procedures 
that are similar or identical to those that apply under current law, but obsolete provisions 
are repealed. Any meaningful or significant changes are discussed below in a subsequent 
section. In the new title governing collective bargaining for public employees, the bill:   
 
 
establishes consistent definitions, including definitions for “public employee” and 
what constitutes a “strike”; 
 
specifies the intent of the General Assembly that it is the public policy of the State 
to encourage and protect the exercise by public-sector employees of their collective 
bargaining rights, as specified; 
 
specifies that laws related to the labor rights of public employees are intended to 
follow the National Labor Relations Act and that decisions of the federal National 
Labor Relations Board may be afforded persuasive weight in any interpretation of 
the bill; 
 
enumerates the collective bargaining rights of public employees, including that they 
may form, join, and participate in, or refrain from forming, joining, or participating 
in, any employee organization of their choosing; 
 
specifies that an employee organization may establish restrictions on who may join 
and provisions for the dismissal of individuals from membership, but may not 
discriminate, as specified; 
 
enumerates the rights of the exclusive representatives that represent public 
employees; 
 
requires public employers to provide exclusive representatives with employee 
information, as specified; 
 
prohibits public employers from engaging in a lockout; 
 
prohibits public employees from engaging in a strike; 

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
HB 984/ Page 3 
 
prohibits public employers and employee organizations from interfering with, 
intimidating, restraining, coercing, or discriminating against a public employee 
because the public employee exercises any right granted by the bill; 
 
prohibits public employers and employee organizations from engaging in any unfair 
labor practices; 
 
establishes the right of exclusive representatives to communicate with employees 
they represent and further establishes rules, procedures, and requirements for 
exclusive representatives to meet with new hires in bargaining units they represent; 
 
authorizes the collection of membership dues by an employee organization and 
includes processes that employers must follow to deduct and remit dues from 
employee salaries; 
 
prohibits public employers from taking certain discouraging actions against 
employees or an employee organization, as specified; 
 
requires representatives of public employers and exclusive representatives to meet 
at reasonable times and engage in collective bargaining in good faith and conclude 
with a written memorandum of understanding, as required by existing collective 
bargaining laws; and 
 
specifies that laws and procedures related to grievances continue to apply. 
 
The bill delineates the rights of the State as an employer, which are substantially similar to 
the rights the State has an employer under current law, including that the State, through its 
appropriate officers and employees, has the right to:   
 
 
determine the mission, budget, organization, numbers, types, and grades of 
employees assigned; the work projects, tours of duty, methods, means, and 
personnel by which its operations are to be conducted; technology needed; internal 
security practices; and relocation of its facilities; 
 
maintain and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations; 
 
determine the services to be rendered, operations to be performed, and technology 
to be used as well as overall methods, processes, means, and classes of work or 
personnel by which governmental operations are to be conducted; 
 
hire, direct, supervise, and assign employees; 
 
promote, demote, discipline, discharge, retain, and lay off employees as well as 
terminate employment for specified reasons; 
 
set the qualifications of employees for appointment and promotion as well as set 
standards of conduct; 
 
adopt State or departmental rules, regulations, or procedures; 
 
provide a system of merit employment according to the standard of business 
efficiency; and 
 
take actions not otherwise specified to carry out the mission of the employer.

Public Employee Relations Board and Elections 
 
The bill repeals all references to SLRB, SHELRB, and PSLRB and instead references 
PERB through a series of technical and conforming changes. PERB must be the successor 
of these three boards and has all the powers and duties granted by law to those boards. Any 
investigation, litigation, or other action pending before these three boards on June 30, 2023, 
must continue before PERB. Regarding PERB, the bill:   
 
 
establishes PERB as an independent unit of State government; 
 
establishes 
membership 
requirements, 
including 
appointment 
processes, 
qualifications, and term limits;  
 
requires the chair of the board to give full time to the duties of chair, entitles the 
chair to a salary as provided in the State budget, and specifies that an appointed 
member of the board is entitled to the compensation provided in the State budget 
and reimbursement for travel expenses; 
 
requires the board to appoint an executive director, specifies the duties of the 
executive director, and authorizes the executive director to hire any staff necessary 
to implement the bill’s requirements;  
 
enumerates the responsibilities and powers of the board, including granting the 
board the authority to issue subpoenas, administer oaths and affirmations, examine 
witnesses, and receive evidence, and requiring the board to adopt and enforce 
regulations, guidelines, and policies to implement the bill’s requirements; 
 
requires the board to appoint three deputy directors (one for Executive Branch labor 
relations, one for public school labor relations, and one for public higher education 
labor relations) and requires each deputy director to receive a salary provided in the 
State budget; 
 
requires the deputy directors to investigate unfair labor practice charges and claims 
using specified processes and procedures and to endeavor at all times to seek 
informal resolution of charges or complaints; 
 
authorizes the board to petition the circuit court to order compliance with board 
orders; 
 
specifies that the board is bound by prior opinions and decisions of SLRB, 
SHELRB, and PSLRB, but not by any prior regulation, order, or action of SLRB, 
SHELRB, or PSLRB (except decisions regarding unit composition), and further 
specifies that the board is bound by certain judicial orders regarding the scope of 
bargaining; 
 
charges PERB with conducting exclusive representative elections as specified and 
establishes related rules, procedures, and requirements; and 
 
grants general authority to PERB to determine the appropriateness of each 
bargaining unit, unless otherwise specified by State law.

Significant and/or Substantive Changes 
 
In addition to the consolidating, technical, and conforming changes discussed above, the 
bill makes several meaningful and/or significant changes to the State’s collective 
bargaining laws, including:   
 
 
expressly requiring additional staff to be hired (e.g., the new deputy director 
positions) and salaries to be paid (e.g., the chair of the board is a salaried position); 
 
establishing the duty to investigate unfair labor practice complaints to the deputy 
directors; 
 
granting the new labor board the authority to issue subpoenas, administer oaths and 
affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence; 
 
establishing more prescriptive processes for exclusive representative elections; and 
 
establishing a new mechanism by which an exclusive representative must be 
certified without an election (i.e., if a petition for an election of an exclusive 
representative is supported by more than 50% of the employees in the bargaining 
unit). 
 
Current Law:   
 
State Employees and Collective Bargaining 
 
Title 3 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article establishes statutory collective 
bargaining rights for a large number of State employees. Maryland’s collective bargaining 
law generally applies to employees of the Executive Branch departments, the Maryland 
Insurance Administration, the State Department of Assessments and Taxation, the State 
Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, the University System of Maryland (USM), the 
Office of the Comptroller, the Maryland Transportation Authority ((MDTA) for those who 
are not police officers), the State Retirement Agency, the Maryland State Department of 
Education, the Maryland Environmental Service, the Maryland School for the Deaf (MSD), 
Morgan State University (MSU), St. Mary’s College of Maryland (SMCM), and 
Baltimore City Community College (BCCC), along with specified firefighters for the 
Martin State Airport and all full-time MDTA police officers at the rank of first sergeant 
and below. 
 
The State’s collective bargaining law does not apply to:   
 
 
Maryland Transit Administration employees; 
 
Legislative and Judicial Branch personnel; 
 
elected and appointed officials;  
 
the Governor’s and Lieutenant Governor’s staff; 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 984/ Page 6 
 
an employee assigned to, or with access to records of, SLRB; 
 
special appointees and executive service personnel in the State Personnel 
Management System (SPMS); 
 
senior administrators, faculty members, student employees, and other designated 
employees of USM, MSU, SMCM, or BCCC; 
 
the chief, deputy, or assistant administrator of a unit with an independent personnel 
system;  
 
temporary or contractual employees in SPMS; 
 
an employee who is entitled to participate in collective bargaining under another 
law; 
 
an employee whose participation in a labor organization is contrary to the State’s 
ethics laws; and 
 
any supervisory, managerial, or confidential employee as defined by regulation. 
 
Parties to the collective bargaining process must make every reasonable effort to conclude 
their negotiations by January 1 for any item requiring appropriation for the fiscal year that 
begins the following July 1. If an impasse is reached during the negotiations, either party 
may request a neutral fact finder; the fact finder’s recommendations are advisory and not 
binding on either party. The Governor must include in the annual budget bill submitted to 
the General Assembly any amounts in the budgets of the principal units required to 
accommodate any additional cost resulting from the negotiations for the fiscal year 
beginning the following July 1, if the legislative changes have been negotiated to become 
effective in that fiscal year. 
 
A “confidential employee” is an employee:   
 
 
who has access to confidential or discretionary information regarding the 
formulation of policy or procedures; 
 
whose functional responsibilities or knowledge concerning employee relations 
makes the employee’s membership in an employee organization incompatible with 
the employee’s duties; or 
 
who is the personal secretary of the chief administrative or executive officer of an 
agency. 
 
Rights of Employees 
 
Employees subject to the State’s collective bargaining law have the right to (1) take part or 
refrain from taking part in forming, joining, supporting, or participating in any employee 
organization or its lawful activities; (2) be fairly represented by their exclusive 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 984/ Page 7 
representative, if any, in collective bargaining; and (3) generally, engage in other concerted 
activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. 
 
Rights of the State 
 
Under the collective bargaining statute, the State has the right to:   
 
 
determine the mission, budget, organization, numbers, types and grades of 
employees assigned, the work projects, tours of duty, methods, means, and 
personnel by which its operations are to be conducted, technology needed, internal 
security practices, and relocation of its facilities and to maintain and improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations; 
 
determine (1) the services to be rendered, operations to be performed, and 
technology to be utilized and (2) overall methods, processes, means, and classes of 
work or personnel by which governmental operations are to be conducted; 
 
hire, direct, supervise, and assign employees; 
 
promote, demote, discipline, discharge, retain, and lay off employees and also 
terminate employment due to lack of funds and other specified reasons; 
 
set the qualifications of employees for appointment and promotion, and set 
standards of conduct; 
 
promulgate State or department rules, regulations, or procedures; 
 
provide a system of merit employment according to the standard of business 
efficiency; and 
 
take actions, not otherwise specified, to carry out its mission. 
 
Labor Relations Boards 
 
SLRB is a five-member independent unit of State government responsible for 
administering and enforcing the State’s collective bargaining law, particularly the 
establishment of new collective bargaining units and the certification of exclusive 
employee representatives for those units. In that capacity, the board holds elections for 
exclusive employee representatives, when petitioned to do so, and adjudicates dispute 
resolution cases related to the collective bargaining process. SHELRB is responsible for 
enforcing collective bargaining laws with respect to employees of public State institutions 
of higher education, and PSLRB is responsible for administering and enforcing the labor 
relations laws for local boards of education and their employees. The three labor boards 
are currently staffed by a common executive director, assistant Attorney General, and 
administrative staff. 
 
Institutions of higher education must have separate bargaining units, and for these 
institutions, appropriate bargaining units must consist of (1) all eligible nonexempt 

END OF PAGE 7

START OF PAGE 8
    
HB 984/ Page 8 
employees except sworn police officers; (2) all eligible exempt employees; and (3) all 
eligible sworn police officers. Additionally, MDTA police officers at the rank of 
first sergeant and below must have a separate bargaining unit, and faculty at MSD must 
have a separate bargaining unit. 
 
State Expenditures:  As previously noted, the three existing labor boards share staff, and 
there are currently three existing full-time staff:  one executive director, one special 
assistant, and one assistant Attorney General. This analysis assumes that these existing staff 
are transferred to PERB since PERB is the successor agency of the boards; however, 
additional salary and staffing costs are anticipated because the bill:   
 
 
entitles the five board members to compensation for their services, with the chair of 
the board being required to serve full time; 
 
authorizes the executive director to hire any staff necessary to implement the bill; 
 
requires the hiring of three deputy directors (which do not exist under current law 
and may be required to be attorneys given the deputy directors’ responsibility to 
oversee unfair labor practice disputes and determine whether there is probable cause 
to issue a complaint); and  
 
authorizes the board to issue subpoenas, administer oaths and affirmations, examine 
witnesses, and receive evidence (the breadth of these responsibilities likely requires 
at least two assistant Attorneys General). 
 
For purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that (1) four of the board members receive an 
annual stipend for their services of $20,000 each; (2) the chair receives a salary of 
approximately $100,000 annually; (3) the three deputy directors receive a salary of 
approximately $80,000 annually; (4) one additional special assistant is hired at an annual 
salary of approximately $60,000; and (5) one additional assistant Attorney General is hired 
at an annual salary of approximately $90,000. This reflects the minimum in additional 
salary and staffing costs for PERB; PERB may be required to set higher salaries to attract 
high quality legal candidates and may require even more staff. 
 
Thus, general fund expenditures increase by an estimated $642,585 in fiscal 2024, which 
accounts for a 90-day start-up delay from the bill’s July 1, 2023 effective date. The estimate 
reflects the cost of hiring and/or paying the salaries listed in the above assumptions. It 
includes salaries, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses.
