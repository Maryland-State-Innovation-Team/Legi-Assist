Maryland Small Business Retirement Savings Program 
 
Chapters 323 and 324 of 2016 established the Maryland Small Business Retirement 
Savings Program and Trust, which required specified private-sector employers to make the 
program available to their employees. Employers who participate in the program or 
otherwise offer a retirement savings arrangement to their employees as specified under the 
law are exempt from the State’s annual filing fee for corporations and business entities 
once the program is operational. The program began operating statewide 
September 15, 2022. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  The bill allows the Maryland Small Business Retirement Savings 
Board to access certain tax information so that the program may operate more effectively. 
The State Treasurer’s Office reports that the bill will help to expand access to the program, 
streamline the registration process for business owners, and create a more efficient means 
for tracking employers. The Comptroller’s Office can handle any additional workload 
resulting from the expanded disclosure authorization with existing resources.
