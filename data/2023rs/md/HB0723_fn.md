Natural Resources – Forest Preservation and Retention 
 
 
This bill modifies State law relating to forest preservation and retention by (1) modifying 
the State’s policy to encourage the retention and sustainable management of forest lands; 
(2) making various changes under the Forest Conservation Act (FCA); and (3) requiring 
the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to establish a workgroup to evaluate and 
recommend incentives for private landowners to conserve forest. The bill’s provisions 
predominantly take effect July 1, 2024, though certain provisions, identified below, 
take effect July 1, 2023. 
   
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) general fund expenditures may increase and 
special fund revenues are potentially affected, beginning as early as FY 2025, as discussed 
below. 
  
Local Effect:  Local government capital expenditures similarly may increase and local 
government revenues are potentially affected, beginning as early as FY 2025, as discussed 
below. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Meaningful. 
  
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
State’s Policy to Encourage the Retention and Sustainable Management of Forest Lands 
 
The bill modifies the State’s policy to encourage the retention and sustainable management 
of forest lands by replacing the outcome of achieving no net loss of forest with the 

END OF PAGE 1

START OF PAGE 2
    
HB 723/ Page 2 
outcomes of increasing, as measured every four years, the acreage of (1) forest land in the 
State and (2) land in the State covered by tree canopy, for land located inside an urban area 
and outside an urban area. 
 
The bill modifies the definition of “forest land” so that it means a contiguous patch of trees 
that is at least one acre in size exhibiting at least one transect of at least 120 feet in width. 
“Tree canopy” means the crowns of deciduous and evergreen woody vegetation that is 
(1) the product of natural growth or human planting and (2) greater than three meters in 
height. 
 
Forest Conservation Act 
 
 
Qualified Conservation  
 
The bill makes permanent, and modifies, provisions enacted under Chapter 645 of 2021 
that (1) modified the definition of “forest mitigation banking” under FCA to include 
qualified conservation (specified conservation of existing forest) and (2) allow for qualified 
conservation – which, by definition, is conservation of existing forest approved for the 
purpose of establishing a forest mitigation bank on or before December 31, 2020 – to be 
used to meet afforestation or reforestation requirements through afforestation or 
reforestation credit for up to 50% of the forest area encumbered in perpetuity. 
 
The bill modifies the provisions enacted under Chapter 645 by (1) removing the 
December 31, 2020, time limitation from the definition of “qualified conservation” and 
(2) only allowing for qualified conservation completed in a forest mitigation bank to be 
used to meet up to 50% of an afforestation or reforestation requirement (and still subject to 
the existing requirement that afforestation or reforestation credit granted for qualified 
conservation not exceed 50% of the forest area encumbered in perpetuity). If a local 
jurisdiction proposes, and after public comment, DNR approves a written justification for 
the increase, qualified conservation completed in a forest mitigation bank may be used to 
meet up to 60% of an afforestation or reforestation requirement, with afforestation or 
reforestation credit not exceeding 50% of the forest area encumbered in perpetuity. 
 
The bill also establishes that after December 31, 2020, mitigation banks using qualified 
conservation may be allowed only (1) if the application was submitted before 
December 31, 2020, or (2) if the qualified conservation is located in priority retention areas 
(see “Priority Areas and Vegetation” below under both the Bill Summary and Current 
Law).

Exemptions from Forest Conservation Act Requirements 
 
The bill repeals an exemption from the requirements of FCA applicable to cutting or 
clearing of land for specified electric generating stations (see “Exemptions from the Forest 
Conservation Act” under Current Law), making the activity subject to FCA requirements. 
The bill, however, establishes that it does not apply to a solarvoltaic facility granted a 
certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) by the Public Service Commission 
(PSC) before July 1, 2023 (under existing public utilities law, subject to limited 
exemptions, a CPCN must be obtained from PSC before beginning construction of an 
electric generating station). Also see below – under “Modified Afforestation, 
Reforestation, and Preservation Requirements” – the afforestation exemption established 
by the bill for solar facilities. 
 
The bill adds exemptions from FCA requirements for: 
 
 
transit-oriented development, provided that the area of forest removed must be 
(1) reforested at a ratio of at least one-quarter acre replanted for each acre removed 
or (2) mitigated in a manner in which one-half acre of forest is permanently 
protected for each acre removed; 
 
 
the construction of a new federal government facility projected to house the 
employment of at least 2,500 persons; and 
 
 
the construction of multifamily housing, consisting of a single structure containing 
at least 25 dwelling units, provided that the area of forest removed must be 
(1) reforested at a ratio of at least one-quarter acre replanted for each acre removed 
or (2) mitigated in a manner in which one-half acre of forest is permanently 
protected for each acre removed. 
 
The bill also clarifies that (1) an existing exemption for agricultural activity includes the 
operation of orchards and tree farms and (2) FCA requirements do not apply to forest 
management. 
 
 
Modified Afforestation, Reforestation, and Preservation Requirements 
 
The bill modifies afforestation, reforestation, and preservation requirements as follows: 
 
 
New Reforestation Requirements – The bill replaces existing conservation 
thresholds and reforestation requirements (described below under Current Law) 
with a requirement that, for all existing forest cover cleared, the area of forest 
removed be reforested at a ratio of one acre planted for every one acre removed. 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
HB 723/ Page 4 
However, for all existing forest cover cleared that is located in a priority funding 
area and not identified as a priority for retention, the area of forest removed must be 
reforested at a ratio of one-half acre planted for every one acre removed. 
 
 
Additional Riparian Buffer Afforestation/Reforestation Requirement – The bill 
additionally requires that, upon meeting the reforestation and afforestation 
requirements, all unforested riparian buffers on site must be afforested and 
reforested, unless the applicant demonstrates to DNR or the local authority (a unit 
of local government administering a local forest conservation program) that 
afforestation in the riparian buffer (1) would be in conflict with allowable uses for 
the riparian buffer; (2) is located on park property and conflicts with the mission 
and established stewardship practices of the park; or (3) is not suitable for the 
establishment and retention of the required planting materials, in which case 
substitute environmental protection measures must be implemented. 
 
 
Afforestation Exemption for Solar Photovoltaic Facilities – The bill establishes that 
solar photovoltaic facilities are not subject to afforestation requirements. 
 
 
Meeting Afforestation and Reforestation Requirements in Specified Areas – The bill 
clarifies and adds available methods that may be used for meeting afforestation and 
reforestation requirements in specified municipalities, existing population centers, 
and other areas, including adding (1) the restoration of on- or off-site degraded 
forest, in which case the afforestation or reforestation credit granted may not exceed 
50% of the area of forest restored and (2) the establishment of planted green 
infrastructure or planted environmental site design practices beyond the amount 
required under Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) stormwater 
management requirements, which may be granted full credit as a mitigation 
technique. 
 
 
Alternative Afforestation, Reforestation, and Preservation Requirements – The bill 
also allows for a local jurisdiction, with approval of DNR, to establish alternative 
afforestation, reforestation, and preservation requirements from those established 
under FCA if the requirements are expected to result in the local forest conservation 
program at a minimum maintaining its existing level of forest cover over a four-year 
period. The bill establishes procedures and criteria for DNR’s evaluation of a local 
jurisdiction’s proposed alternative requirements.  
 
DNR must, by December 31, 2028, provide written notice requiring modification of 
a local forest conservation program’s alternative requirements if the local program 
does not (1) maintain or expand the local jurisdiction’s existing level of forest cover 
over two consecutive two-year periods or (2) submit specified annual reports 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 723/ Page 5 
containing local program data (required under existing law). Beginning 
January 1, 2029, DNR may rescind its approval of alternative requirements if a local 
program does not meet either of those two requirements. 
 
 
Priority Areas and Vegetation 
 
The bill clarifies and adds specified areas and vegetation that are considered priority for 
retention and protection and, pursuant to existing law, must be left undisturbed unless an 
applicant has demonstrated that reasonable efforts have been made to protect them and the 
applicant’s forest conservation plan cannot reasonably be altered. The bill does not modify 
separate specified areas and vegetation that are considered priority for retention and 
protection and must be left undisturbed unless an applicant has demonstrated that the 
applicant qualifies for a specified variance based on unwarranted hardship. 
 
The bill requires DNR or a local authority to issue written findings and justification for any 
clearing of a priority retention area and establishes that any judicial review of a final 
determination made with respect to priority retention areas and vegetation must be 
conducted in accordance with the Maryland Rules and limited to the record compiled by 
DNR or the local authority. These requirements apply both to priority retention 
areas/vegetation (1) that must be left undisturbed unless an applicant has demonstrated that 
reasonable efforts have been made to protect them and the applicant’s forest conservation 
plan cannot reasonably be altered and (2) that must be left undisturbed unless an applicant 
has demonstrated that the applicant qualifies for a specified variance based on unwarranted 
hardship. 
 
 
Forest Conservation Plans 
 
The bill requires DNR or the local authority to, at least 20 days before approval of a forest 
conservation plan: 
 
 
provide notice that is consistent with local authority notice requirements to all 
property owners abutting and adjacent to the boundary of the subject property of 
any proposed clearing of a priority retention area; and 
 
 
(1) on a net tract area of at least five acres, if at least 75% of the priority retention 
area is proposed to be cleared, provide an opportunity for written and verbal 
comment before plan approval or (2) for any other project where priority retention 
area is proposed for clearing, provide an opportunity for public written comment 
before plan approval. 
 
Property separated from the subject property by a public right of way must be considered 
abutting and adjacent. 
 
 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 723/ Page 6 
The bill requires a person petitioning for judicial review of an approved forest conservation 
plan to file the petition in accordance with the Maryland Rules not later than 30 days after 
approval of the forest conservation plan. Any judicial review of a forest conservation plan 
must be (1) conducted in accordance with the Maryland Rules and (2) limited to the record 
compiled by DNR or the local authority. 
 
 
Local Forest Conservation Programs 
 
The bill adds to an existing requirement, that a local authority’s development of a local 
forest conservation program be consistent with the intent, requirements, and standards of 
FCA, by requiring that the local government’s development of a program also afford due 
consideration to (1) goals established under the State Economic Growth, Resource 
Protection, and Planning Policy; (2) the State’s agricultural land preservation goal of 
preserving a total of 1,030,000 acres of productive agricultural land by 2030 through 
specified programs; and (3) policy goals established under local comprehensive plans. 
 
The bill also alters an authorization for a local forest conservation program, when approved 
by DNR, to waive the requirements under FCA for previously developed areas covered by 
impervious surface and located in priority funding areas at the time of the application for 
subdivision plan, grading, or sediment control permit approval. The bill alters the 
authorization by authorizing a local program to instead provide for the waiver or 
modification of FCA requirements for those areas. 
 
Provisions That Take Effect July 1, 2023 
 
 
Forest Conservation Fund 
 
The bill increases the amount of time within which DNR must accomplish reforestation or 
afforestation for which money is deposited in the State Forest Conservation Fund, before 
any portion that has not been used must be returned to the person who provided the money 
to be used for documented tree planting in the same county or watershed beyond that 
required by FCA or other applicable statutes. The amount of time is increased from 
two years or three growing seasons to five years or six growing seasons. The bill also 
establishes that the money must be used, or encumbered, within that time period. 
 
 
Update of State Forest Conservation Manual 
 
DNR must update the State Forest Conservation Manual by December 31, 2024, to make 
it consistent with the bill’s changes, and the updates must include specified guidance and 
standards. 
 
 
 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 723/ Page 7 
 
Workgroup on Incentives for Forest Conservation by Private Landowners 
 
DNR must establish a workgroup to evaluate and recommend incentives for private 
landowners to conserve forest, including adjusting the minimal acreage of contiguous 
forested land required to qualify for the Forest Conservation and Management Program 
(discussed under Current Law). 
 
 
Approval of Alternative Requirements 
 
By December 31, 2023, DNR must (1) issue a description of the procedures it will use to 
determine whether a local program is expected to maintain or expand the existing level of 
forest cover in the jurisdiction and (2) approve or reject alternative afforestation, 
reforestation, and preservation requirements adopted by a local jurisdiction before 
September 1, 2023. 
 
 
Applicability of the Bill 
 
The bill does not apply to (1) a forest conservation plan approved before July 1, 2024, that 
is associated with a subdivision plan, site plan, building permit, or grading or sediment 
control application or (2) a revision to those plans or permits that does not materially alter 
the proposed or actual limits of disturbance. 
 
As mentioned above, the bill does not apply to a solarvoltaic facility granted a CPCN by 
PSC before July 1, 2023. 
 
Current Law: 
 
State’s Policy to Encourage the Retention and Sustainable Management of Forest Lands 
 
It is the policy of the State to encourage the retention and sustainable management of forest 
lands by, among other things, achieving no net loss of forest. “Forest land” means a 
biological community dominated by trees and other woody plants that are capable of 
producing timber or other wood products with a stocking of at least 100 trees per acre with 
at least 50% of those trees having a 2-inch or greater diameter at 4.5 feet above the ground. 
“Forest land” includes forested areas that have been cut but not converted to other land 
uses.

HB 723/ Page 8 
Forest Conservation Act 
 
 
In General 
 
The Forest Service within DNR administers FCA, but it is primarily implemented on the 
local level. FCA establishes minimum forest conservation requirements for land 
development, and local governments with planning and zoning authority are required to 
develop local forest conservation programs that meet or are more stringent than the 
requirements of FCA. However, Allegany and Garrett counties, and municipalities within 
those counties, are exempt from the requirements of FCA (see “Exemptions from the Forest 
Conservation Act” below). FCA applies to any public or private subdivision plan or 
application for a grading or sediment control permit by any person, including a unit of State 
or local government, on areas 40,000 square feet (0.9 acres) or greater, subject to certain 
exceptions. 
 
A proposed construction activity goes through a process of evaluation of existing 
vegetation on a site and development of a forest conservation plan for the site defining how 
forest area will be retained and/or afforestation or reforestation will be undertaken. If 
afforestation or reforestation requirements cannot be reasonably accomplished on-site or 
off-site (which can include use of off-site forest mitigation banks), payment may be made 
into the applicable forest conservation fund (fee-in-lieu payments) to be spent by the State 
or the local government on reforestation and afforestation, maintenance of existing forest, 
and achieving urban canopy goals. 
 
 
Local Forest Conservation Programs 
 
As mentioned above, a unit of local government with planning and zoning authority must 
develop and adopt a local forest conservation program, consistent with the intent, 
requirements, and standards of FCA, that meets or is more stringent than the requirements 
and standards established by FCA. Local governments are authorized to adopt forest 
conservation thresholds and afforestation and reforestation requirements as part of a local 
forest conservation program that are more stringent than the forest conservation thresholds 
and afforestation and reforestation requirements under FCA. If the local jurisdiction does 
not adopt a program, DNR must review and approve all forest conservation plans in that 
jurisdiction. A municipality may assign its obligations to develop and adopt a forest 
conservation program to its home county with the approval of the county and DNR. 
 
A local program must include a policy document and all applicable new and amended local 
ordinances relating to implementation of the regulated activities; exemptions; review, 
approval, and appeal processes; incentives; protective legal instruments; enforcement; and 
penalties. A local program must also include a technical manual that describes application 
submission requirements for forest stand delineations, required information for forest 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 723/ Page 9 
conservation plan approval, specific forest conservation criteria, and protection techniques. 
A local program may allow clustering or other innovative land use techniques and may 
waive the requirements of FCA for certain previously developed areas that are covered in 
impervious surface and located in priority funding areas. 
 
DNR is required to perform a compliance review of each local program at least once every 
two years. If a local program is found to be deficient, DNR must notify the local authority 
and allow the local authority 90 days to comply with the standards and requirements of 
FCA. After this 90-day compliance period, DNR may (1) assume review and approval 
responsibilities for all forest conservation plans in that jurisdiction until the deficiencies 
are corrected; (2) on a finding by an auditor of misappropriation of local forest conservation 
funds, require payment to the State Forest Conservation Fund; or (3) request that the 
Attorney General investigate payments and expenditures of funds collected by the local 
authority under FCA. 
 
 
Interpretation of What Constitutes Forest Mitigation Banking 
 
Historically, local forest mitigation banking programs have provided credits to developers 
who preserve existing forested lands by recording restrictive easements that run in 
perpetuity. However, in October 2020, the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) issued 
an opinion addressing whether FCA allowed off-site forest mitigation banks that were 
established to preserve existing forest. In its opinion, OAG concluded that the placement 
of a protective easement on an already-existing forest, as opposed to intentionally created 
or restored forest, would not qualify as mitigation banking under FCA. As a result, at least 
some local governments suspended the granting of credits for existing forest. 
 
To restore the historical interpretation and allow retention mitigation banks (conservation 
of existing forest), Chapter 645 altered the definition of “forest mitigation banking” to 
mean the intentional restoration, creation, or qualified conservation of forests undertaken 
expressly for the purpose of providing credits for afforestation or reforestation 
requirements with enhanced environmental benefits from future activities. 
 
 
Qualified Conservation 
 
Pursuant to Chapter 645, “qualified conservation” means the conservation of all or a part 
of an existing forest that (1) was approved on or before December 31, 2020, by the 
appropriate State or local forest conservation program for the purpose of establishing a 
forest mitigation bank and (2) is encumbered in perpetuity by a restrictive easement, 
covenant, or another similar mechanism recorded in the county land records to conserve 
its character as a forest. 
 

END OF PAGE 9

START OF PAGE 10
    
HB 723/ Page 10 
Qualified conservation completed in a forest mitigation bank may be used, by a State or 
local forest conservation program, as a method in establishing standards for meeting 
afforestation or reforestation requirements under FCA. The afforestation or reforestation 
credit granted for qualified conservation completed in a forest mitigation bank may not 
exceed 50% of the forest area encumbered in perpetuity. Credits in a mitigation bank may 
not be approved for debiting until qualified conservation of the mitigation bank is 
complete. 
 
The forest mitigation banking provisions of Chapter 645 terminate June 30, 2024. 
 
 
Exemptions from the Forest Conservation Act 
 
There are several activities that FCA does not apply to, including: 
 
 
commercial logging and timber harvesting operations on property that is not the 
subject of an application for a grading permit for development within five years after 
the logging or harvesting operation; 
 
 
any agricultural activity that does not result in a change in land use category, 
including agricultural support buildings and other related structures built using 
accepted best management practices; and 
 
 
the cutting or clearing of public utility rights-of-way or land for electric generating 
stations licensed pursuant to specified provisions of the Public Utilities Article of 
the Maryland Code, provided that (1) any required CPCNs have been issued in 
accordance with a requirement under FCA that PSC give due consideration to the 
need to minimize the loss of forest, the FCA provisions for afforestation and 
reforestation, and all applicable electrical safety codes, when reviewing applications 
for a CPCN and (2) the cutting or clearing of the forest is conducted so as to 
minimize the loss of forest. 
 
FCA also does not apply to a county that has and maintains 200,000 acres or more of its 
land area in forest cover. DNR indicates that Allegany and Garrett counties fall under this 
exemption and, as a result, development within those counties is not subject to FCA 
requirements. 
 
 
Afforestation Requirements 
 
Under FCA, if the existing forested area of a site is below a specified percentage of the net 
tract area, it must be afforested (establishing forested area where there is none) up to the 
specified percentage of the net tract area. For agricultural and resource areas and medium 
density residential areas, the percentage is 20%. For institutional development areas, high 

END OF PAGE 10

START OF PAGE 11
    
HB 723/ Page 11 
density residential areas, mixed use and planned unit development areas, and commercial 
and industrial use areas, the percentage is 15%. As mentioned above, local forest 
conservation programs adopted under FCA may include afforestation requirements, as well 
as conservation thresholds and reforestation requirements (described below), that are more 
stringent than those under FCA. 
 
 
Conservation Thresholds and Reforestation Requirements 
 
FCA establishes requirements for reforestation (replacement of cleared forest land) which 
are determined based on a conservation threshold, which is a percentage of the net tract 
area of a site. If the portion of the net tract area which is forested is below the percentage, 
or if clearing causes it to be below the percentage, any clearing of forested area below the 
percentage must be replaced at a ratio of 2 to 1. For clearing above the threshold percentage, 
cleared forest must be replaced at a ratio of one quarter to 1, with the exception that each 
acre of forest retained above the applicable forest conservation threshold is credited against 
the number of acres required to be forested pursuant to the one quarter to 1 reforestation 
ratio. The conservation threshold varies by land use category: 
 
 
agricultural and resource areas – 50% of net tract area; 
 
 
medium density residential areas – 25% of net tract area; 
 
 
institutional development areas – 20% of net tract area; 
 
 
high density residential areas – 20% of net tract area; 
 
 
mixed use and planned unit development areas – 15% of net tract area; and 
 
 
commercial and industrial use areas – 15% of net tract area. 
 
Priority Areas and Vegetation 
 
Under FCA, specified trees, shrubs, plants, and specific areas are considered priority for 
retention and protection for reasons such as the characteristics of the trees, shrubs, and 
plants or the importance of vegetation in areas such as floodplains, stream buffers, and 
critical habitats. The priority areas and vegetation must be left in an undisturbed condition 
unless an applicant (1) has demonstrated that reasonable efforts have been made to protect 
them and the applicant’s forest conservation plan cannot reasonably be altered, for certain 
areas and vegetation or (2) qualifies for a specified variance based on unwarranted 
hardship, for other areas and vegetation.

HB 723/ Page 12 
 
Decision Procedures and Appeals 
 
As mentioned above, statute requires that a local forest conservation program include a 
policy document and all applicable new and amended local ordinances relating to – among 
other things – review, approval, and appeal processes. DNR’s regulations, under criteria 
for evaluating local forest conservation programs, require that a local government 
demonstrate that under the local program’s administrative review, approval, and appeal 
procedures, the hearing and appeal procedures are consistent with the local appellate 
review procedures.  The Supreme Court of Maryland (formerly the Court of Appeals), in 
Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc. (CBF) v. CREG Westport Developers I, LLC, 
481 Md. 325 (2022), indicated that FCA, and DNR’s implementing regulations, “by their 
plain and unambiguous language, require that local forest conservation programs have 
‘appeal procedures’ in place as part of their local programs.” The Court held in 
CBF v. CREG Westport Developers I, that an approval of a forest conservation plan and an 
associated waiver (variance) by the Harford County Department of Planning and Zoning 
was a final decision that could be appealed to the circuit court in Harford County pursuant 
to provisions of the Harford County Code. 
 
For forest conservation plans reviewed by DNR, which include those for State projects and 
certain local projects using State funds, DNR regulations establish procedures for public 
notice of a submitted forest conservation plan and an opportunity to submit written 
comments or request a public hearing. The regulations require DNR to mail written notice 
of the approval decision or denial to the applicant and persons on an interested persons list. 
Notice of the decision does not need to be published. The regulations allow for a contested 
case hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act to be requested, within 30 days of 
issuance of the decision, by a person who has legal rights, duties, interests, or privileges 
different from the general public which are adversely affected by the department’s decision 
to approve, deny, or condition a final forest conservation plan. A denial of a request for a 
contested case hearing, and an adverse decision in a contested case, can be appealed to the 
circuit court. 
 
FCA requires that DNR and local programs provide for the granting of variances from 
requirements of the Act where, owing to special features of a site or other circumstances, 
implementation of FCA would result in unwarranted hardship to an applicant. DNR 
regulations require that the department or the local authority make findings that an 
applicant has met the requirements applicable to a variance. 
 
 
Forest Conservation Fund 
 
The State Forest Conservation Fund holds funds associated with projects reviewed by the 
State, and local forest conservation funds are associated with local forest conservation 
programs. DNR must accomplish the reforestation or afforestation for which funds are 

END OF PAGE 12

START OF PAGE 13
    
HB 723/ Page 13 
deposited into the fund within two years or three growing seasons after receipt of the funds. 
Deposited funds must remain in the fund for a period of two years and three growing 
seasons, after which any portion of the funds that have not been used must be returned to 
the person who provided the funds to be used for documented tree planting. 
 
Forest Conservation and Management Program 
 
Under the Forest Conservation and Management Program, the owner of at least 
five contiguous acres of land may make an agreement with DNR to place the land in the 
program. The purpose of the program is to (1) encourage the preservation or development 
of land for productive woodland purposes; (2) increase the income of persons in the State 
from the sale of timber; (3) prevent flooding of land and the loss of the State’s soil; 
(4) provide wooded areas for the use and enjoyment of all individuals in the State; and 
(5) promote the welfare and assets of the State. An agreement must be for at least 15 years 
and the value of woodland for property tax assessment purposes in effect at the beginning 
of an agreement may not be increased for the period covered by the agreement. 
 
State/Local Fiscal Effect:  The bill has the following impacts on State and local finances, 
beginning as early as fiscal 2025 (accounting for the July 1, 2024 effective date of most of 
the bill’s provisions, including those that have a fiscal impact): 
 
 
State and Local Construction Costs – PAYGO general fund expenditures and local 
government capital expenditures may increase, due to potential additional costs 
overall, for State and local construction projects to comply with the modified 
reforestation 
requirements 
under 
the 
bill 
(and 
the 
riparian 
buffer 
afforestation/reforestation requirement, in any cases where it applies) to the extent 
forest needs to be cleared for State and local projects. Public, along with private, 
development projects are subject to FCA. Any increase in State costs for FCA 
compliance is assumed to only potentially affect PAYGO general fund expenditures 
(funded through the State operating budget). The State’s capital program is 
determined annually through the capital budget process and subject to debt 
affordability limits; unless additional costs are funded with PAYGO general funds, 
any increase in costs for FCA compliance is assumed to limit funding available for 
other projects under the capital program but not increase overall expenditures. State 
projects are subject to the State forest conservation program administered by DNR, 
and related fee-in-lieu payments made are deposited in the State Forest 
Conservation Fund. Local projects may be subject to the State or a local program, 
depending on whether State funding is used for the project and whether or not the 
local jurisdiction has a local forest conservation program. The extent of any impact 
depends on the details of a project and the associated site.

HB 723/ Page 14 
 
State Forest Conservation Fund and Local Forest Conservation Funds – State 
special fund and local revenues from fee-in-lieu payments received and deposited 
in the State Forest Conservation Fund and local forest conservation funds are 
potentially affected by the offsetting impacts of (1) the bill’s modified reforestation 
requirements under FCA potentially increasing fee-in-lieu payments  and (2) the bill 
allowing for greater use of forest mitigation banks to meet afforestation and 
reforestation requirements in place of fee-in-lieu payments, potentially decreasing 
fee-in-lieu payments. The net effect of these offsetting impacts cannot be 
determined at this time. The bill’s provision that extends the timeframe for DNR to 
expend funds from the State Forest Conservation Fund before they revert to the 
person who provided the funds is not anticipated to materially affect State special 
fund expenditures. 
 
The bill’s modification to the State’s policy to encourage the retention and sustainable 
management of forest lands is not expected to have a direct fiscal impact on the State or 
local governments. 
 
DNR expects to implement the bill, and its requirements of the department, with existing 
resources. It is assumed that local governments can similarly implement the bill with 
existing resources. 
 
MDE indicates that it can handle minor operational impacts resulting from the bill with 
existing resources. 
 
Small Business Effect:  The bill likely has a meaningful effect on various small businesses, 
including those engaging in construction activity, those that own or establish forest 
mitigation 
banks, 
and 
businesses 
providing 
material 
and 
services 
for 
reforestation/afforestation and FCA or local forest conservation program compliance 
(nurseries, landscapers, consultants). 
 
In cases where the bill’s changes increase reforestation and/or afforestation requirements 
for a given project, for example, costs increase for small businesses engaging in 
construction, but business increases for those supporting reforestation/afforestation efforts 
and FCA or local forest conservation program compliance. For certain development, 
however, because of the exemptions under the bill, reforestation/ afforestation and related 
compliance costs/activity decrease rather than increase, since (1) reforestation 
requirements may decrease for a given project, and afforestation and priority retention area 
preservation requirements are eliminated, for transit-oriented development and specified 
multifamily housing and (2) no FCA requirements apply to a specified new federal 
government facility (see “Exemptions from Forest Conservation Act Requirements” under 
Bill Summary).
