Department of Legislative Services 
Maryland General Assembly 
2023 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 1298 
(Delegate Chang) 
Appropriations 
Budget and Taxation 
 
Prior Authorizations of State Debt - Alterations 
 
 
This bill modifies authorizations of State debt in prior year capital budgets by extending 
deadlines for expending or encumbering funds, removing matching fund requirements, 
renaming grant recipients, altering project locations, and/or altering the purpose for which 
funds may be used. In some cases, altering the purpose of grant funds merely makes minor 
or technical changes for how the funds may be used; in other cases, grant funds may be 
reassigned to an entirely different purpose. The bill also (1) repeals a requirement that a 
specified grantee convey and grant a historic easement to the Maryland Historical Trust 
(MHT) and (2) restricts the Baltimore City Mayor and City Council from expending or 
encumbering specified grant funds until the Baltimore City Council passes a resolution to 
rename a certain field. The bill takes effect June 1, 2023.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  The bill modifies the conditions under which State grant funds may be used. 
These changes do not materially affect State finances.  
  
Local Effect:  None, unless the grantee is a local government.

HB 1298/ Page 2 
Current Law:  In general, when a matching fund is required, a grantee must present 
evidence of the matching fund to the Board of Public Works within two years of the 
authorization for State debt, and the matching fund must be certified prior to the grantee’s 
expending or encumbering State funds.  
 
Generally, and if applicable, specified grantees must convey a historic easement to MHT 
as specified in the annual capital budget bill.  
 
Chapter 153 of 2003 established a seven-year limitation on the authority to spend an 
appropriation for a capital expenditure and a seven-year limitation on the authorization for 
State debt unless otherwise provided in an enabling act. The Act applies to all debt 
authorized on or after June 1, 1997.  
 
 
Additional Information 
 
Prior Introductions:  Similar legislation has not been introduced within the last 
three years. 
 
Designated Cross File:  None.

4 Restricts the Baltimore City Mayor and City Council (grantees) from encumbering or expending the specified authorization until  
the Baltimore City Council passes a resolution to rename the Reach Partnership Field as the Senator Robert L. Dalton Stadium. 
5 Alters the location of specified projects to be within Allegany County. 
6 Alters the location of the project to be within Anne Arundel County. 
 
Note:  Hospice of the Chesapeake acquired Hospice of Charles County in 2020. Accordingly, the purpose change noted above is technical as the 
Hospice House of Charles County is the Hospice of the Chesapeake Facility. The grantee for that project, however, is changed to be the parent 
nonprofit organization.
