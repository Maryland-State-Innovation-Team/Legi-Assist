Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Conservation Goals 
 
The bill establishes the intent of the General Assembly that (1) by 2030, 30% of lands in 
the State be conserved and (2) by 2040, 40% of lands in the State be conserved. To meet 
the specified conservation goals, the Smart Growth Subcabinet, in coordination with 
relevant stakeholders, must (1) coordinate the actions of State agencies, local governments, 
and nongovernmental partners; (2) by July 1, 2024, develop and publish a plan to meet the 
State’s conservation goals and update the plan as needed (but not less than every 
five years thereafter); and (3) by December 1, 2024, and each December 1 thereafter, report 
to specified committees of the General Assembly on the State’s progress toward meeting 
the conservation goals. 
 
“Conserve” means to permanently protect land from development through purchase, 
donation, a perpetual conservation or an open space easement, or fee ownership in order to 
preserve the cultural, historical, ecological, or agricultural value of the land. 
 
The conservation goals must be accomplished through multiple efforts, including:   
 
 
working with local communities, counties, municipalities, American Indian 
communities, and private landowners to conserve natural places and resources; 
 
improving access to nature for all individuals in the State, including communities 
of color and economically disadvantaged communities; 
 
sequestering carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in lands and waters of the State; 
 
increasing public incentives for private landowners to voluntarily conserve and 
protect areas of demonstrated conservation value and areas that have a high capacity 
to sequester carbon and greenhouse gas emissions; 
 
focusing conservation work at a large landscape scale that is biologically and 
ecologically meaningful; 
 
preventing the extinction of native plant and animal species by recovering and 
restoring the species; 
 
stabilizing ecosystems and ecosystem services, restoring degraded ecosystems, and 
maintaining ecological functions; and 
 
increasing economic opportunities for farmers, ranchers, fishers, and foresters.

40 x 40 Land Conservation Implementation Grant Program 
 
The Maryland Environmental Trust (MET) must administer a 40 x 40 Land Conservation 
Implementation Grant Program to support implementation of the conservation goals 
established by the bill. Program grants must:   
 
 
be awarded each year on a competitive basis to a nonprofit organization that focuses 
on supporting the permanent conservation of the lands of the State; and 
 
provide at least (1) $150,000 to the grant recipient for the purpose of providing tools 
and resources, organizational support, and capacity building to local land trusts and 
(2) $100,000 to the grant recipient for the purpose of providing statewide 
educational conferences and trainings for local land trusts on the topics of easement 
acquisition, conservation programs and tools, land management and stewardship, 
and other relevant subjects. 
 
In fiscal 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter, the Governor may include in the annual 
budget bill an appropriation of $250,000 to MET for the purpose of providing the grants. 
 
Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Program 
 
 
Purpose and Administration 
 
The purpose of the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Program is to (1) support the efforts 
of local land trusts that work with State and local governmental entities and (2) provide 
revolving loans to land trusts on a rolling basis to assist the land trusts to purchase fee 
simple or easement interests in real property for conservation purposes. MET must 
(1) administer the program; (2) establish application procedures and eligibility criteria for 
program loans; (3) prepare loan documents for approved loans; and (4) establish terms and 
conditions for the loans. “Land trust” is defined as a qualified conservation organization 
that (1) is a qualified organization under a specified provision of the Internal Revenue Code 
and regulations adopted under the provision and (2) has executed a cooperative agreement 
with MET. 
 
A land trust that receives a program loan must repay the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan 
Fund, described below, (1) at a rate to be determined by MET, not to exceed one point 
below the prime interest rate and (2) after the property is placed under a conservation 
easement or transferred to a State or local governmental entity. However, a land trust must 
repay a program loan and any accrued interest within five years after receiving the loan, 
whether or not the property has been placed under a conservation easement or transferred 
to a State or local government entity, unless MET’s board of trustees approves an extension 
of time based on extenuating circumstances. The bill does not obligate a State or local 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
SB 470/ Page 4 
government entity to accept or purchase from a land trust a conservation easement or 
transferred property purchased with a program loan. 
 
If a land trust violates any provision of the loan documents or ceases to meet the 
requirements of the bill’s provisions governing the program or other statutory provisions 
governing MET, on reasonable notice to the land trust, MET may exercise any remedy 
available under law, including any remedies provided for in the loan documents.  
 
The bill also prohibits a person from knowingly making or causing to be made specified 
false statements or reports and establishes that a violation of the bill’s provisions governing 
the program or other statutory provisions governing MET is a misdemeanor subject to a 
fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years. 
 
 
Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Fund 
 
The Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Fund must be administered by MET to finance the 
revolving loan program. The fund consists of money appropriated in the State budget to 
the fund, interest earnings, repayments of principal and interest from loans made under the 
program, and any other money from any other source accepted for the benefit of the fund. 
The bill authorizes the Governor to include an appropriation to the fund in the annual 
budget bill and, if actual transfer tax revenue collections in fiscal 2023 are greater than the 
revenue estimates used as the basis for the appropriations of transfer tax revenue required 
under existing law for fiscal 2023, the amount of the excess may be allocated to the fund 
in fiscal 2025. The provision authorizing the allocation of excess fiscal 2023 transfer tax 
revenue collections to the fund terminates September 30, 2026. 
 
 
Land Preservation Rapid Response Advisory Committee 
 
The bill establishes a Land Preservation Rapid Response Advisory Committee to 
(1) review and prioritize program loan applications for consideration by MET’s board of 
trustees and (2) make recommendations to the board of trustees on which projects to fund 
and the funding to be allocated to each project. 
 
Stewardship Grants 
 
The bill authorizes the Governor, in fiscal 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter, to include 
in the annual budget bill an appropriation of $235,000 to MET to be used in the following 
amounts for the following purposes:   
 
 
$50,000 per year to provide land stewardship capacity-building grants of up to 
$10,000 to land trusts to support monitoring and stewardship scholarships, land 
monitoring and stewardship equipment, or organizational accreditation and 
certification trainings; 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
SB 470/ Page 5 
 
$50,000 per year to provide land stewardship improvement grants of up to 
$10,000 to land trusts to support improved monitoring and stewardship of 
agricultural lands, forest lands, or lands facing a high degree of threat from invasive 
species or the effects of climate change; and 
 
$135,000 per year to provide citizen stewardship grants of up to $5,000 to nonprofit 
organizations, community organizations, schools, and municipalities to engage 
community members, especially children and young adults, in environmental 
education and stewardship. 
 
The grant funding is supplemental to and not intended to take the place of funding that 
would otherwise be appropriated to MET for grants administered under the Keep Maryland 
Beautiful Program. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Agricultural Land Preservation Goal 
 
Chapter 284 of 2021 established a State goal of preserving a total of 1,030,000 acres of 
productive agricultural land by 2030, through local land preservation programs and several 
State programs, including:   
 
 
Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF):  The 
General Assembly created MALPF to preserve productive agricultural land and 
woodland, limit the extent of urban development, and protect agricultural land and 
woodland as open space. MALPF, with the assistance and cooperation of 
landowners and local governments, purchases development rights easements as a 
means of protecting agricultural land and woodland production activities; 
 
Maryland GreenPrint Program:  Chapter 570 of 2001 established the Maryland 
GreenPrint Program to create a statewide green infrastructure network by acquiring 
property and property interests, including easements, in a manner that complements 
other conservation programs. Chapter 570 terminated in 2006, although acres that 
were preserved under the program contribute toward the State’s agricultural land 
preservation goal; 
 
Rural Legacy Program:  The Rural Legacy Program within the Department of 
Natural Resources (DNR) provides funding for local governments and conservation 
organizations (such as land trusts) to purchase property and conservation easements 
within designated rural legacy areas. Rural legacy areas are designated as rich in a 
multitude of agricultural, forestry, natural, and cultural resources. Local 
governments and land trusts apply annually to the Rural Legacy Board, which 
makes recommendations for designating rural legacy areas and granting funds to 
preserve land in the rural legacy areas that are then reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Public Works;

SB 470/ Page 6 
 
Maryland Environmental Trust:  MET was established by statute in 1967 “to 
conserve, improve, stimulate, and perpetuate the aesthetic, natural, health and 
welfare, scenic, and cultural qualities of the environment, including, but not limited 
to land, water, air, wildlife, scenic qualities, [and] open spaces.” The trust was 
created as a quasi-public entity and is both a unit of DNR and governed by a private 
board of trustees. MET’s primary method for protecting land is through soliciting 
donations of conservation easements from private landowners, who may be eligible 
for both federal and State tax benefits that are available for such donations. Its 
programs now include Land Conservation, Monitoring and Stewardship, Local 
Land Trust Assistance, and the Keep Maryland Beautiful Grant Program; and 
 
Next Generation Farmland Acquisition Program:  The Next Generation Farmland 
Acquisition Program (“Next Gen Program”) is administered by the Maryland 
Agricultural 
and 
Resource-Based 
Industry 
Development 
Corporation 
(MARBIDCO), which was established under Chapter 467 of 2004 to help 
Maryland’s farm, forestry, seafood, and related rural businesses to achieve 
profitability and sustainability. Under statutory authority to administer rural land 
acquisition and easement programs, including programs to assist young and 
beginning farmers, MARBIDCO administers the Next Gen Program, and the 
recently begun Small Acreage Next Generation Farmland Acquisition Program, 
which help young and beginning farmers purchase land, with the purchases made 
under the programs resulting in, or typically leading to, permanent easements on the 
land. 
 
Smart Growth Subcabinet 
 
The Smart Growth Subcabinet comprises the Special Secretary; the Secretary of 
Agriculture; the Secretary of Budget and Management; the Secretary of Commerce; the 
Secretary of the Environment; the Secretary of General Services; the Secretary of Higher 
Education; the Secretary of Housing and Community Development; the Assistant Secretary 
of the Office of Neighborhood Revitalization; the Secretary of Natural Resources; the 
Secretary of Planning; the Secretary of Transportation; a representative of the Governor’s 
office; the Secretary of Health; the Secretary of Labor; and the Director of the Maryland 
Energy Administration. The subcabinet must:   
 
 
provide a forum for discussion of interdepartmental issues relating to activities that 
affect growth, development, neighborhood conservation, and resource management; 
 
work together to promote the understanding of smart growth; 
 
work together to create, enhance, support, and revitalize sustainable communities; 
 
meet at least biannually with county and municipal elected leaders and planning 
officials to discuss local government issues relating to activities that affect smart 
growth, development, neighborhood conservation, and resource management; 

END OF PAGE 6

SB 470/ Page 7 
 
make recommendations to specified State agencies; 
 
evaluate and report annually to the Governor and the General Assembly on the 
implementation of the State's smart growth policy; and 
 
perform other duties assigned by the Governor. 
 
State Transfer Tax Funding Allocation and Program Open Space  
 
 
Funding Allocation 
 
The State transfer tax of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer of real property is 
used to fund several land conservation programs as well as State forest and park operations. 
After certain initial allocations for debt service and administrative costs, the revenue is held 
in a transfer tax special fund and allocated according to the following percentages (“transfer 
tax formula”):  (1) 76.15% to Program Open Space (POS), administered by DNR; 
(2) 17.05% to MALPF; (3) 5% to the Rural Legacy Program; and (4) 1.8% to the Heritage 
Conservation Fund. 
 
 
Program Open Space 
 
The 76.15% allocated to POS through the transfer tax formula is subject to further required 
allocations among different uses, including State land acquisition and capital 
improvements for recreation and open space purposes, local government acquisition and 
development of land for recreation and open space purposes, and State forest and park 
operations. Subject to certain additional detail and allocations, in general, approximately 
50% is allocated to State land acquisition and capital development, 30% is allocated to 
local government acquisition and development, and 20% is allocated to State forest and 
park operations. 
 
To participate in the POS grant process, a local government must prepare a local Land 
Preservation and Recreation Plan every five years. Each participating local government 
must also submit an annual program of proposed acquisition and development projects to 
DNR and the Maryland Department of Planning (MDP). The annual program is the basis 
for total allocations to each local government. 
 
 
Allocation of Excess Revenue 
 
For any fiscal year in which the actual transfer tax revenue collections are greater than the 
revenue estimates used as the basis for the appropriations of the revenues for the fiscal year, 
the amount of the excess must be allocated in accordance with the transfer tax formula in 
the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which there is an excess (e.g., an excess 
in fiscal 2023 is allocated/appropriated in fiscal 2025).

State Fiscal Effect:   
 
Conservation Goals 
 
It is unclear to what extent State spending on land conservation increases over the course 
of fiscal 2024 through 2040 as a result of the bill’s conservation goals, which aim to 
conserve (1) 30% of lands in the State by 2030 and (2) 40% of lands in the State by 2040. 
Establishing the goals in statute may increase the likelihood that land conservation program 
funding levels (not including those established under the bill) increase in fiscal 2024 
through 2040. 
 
MDP indicates that, as of June 30, 2022, approximately 868,627 acres of productive 
agricultural land have been preserved, which is 84.3% of the 1,030,000-acre goal 
established by Chapter 284. Overall, 1,839,453 acres of total land, approximately 29% of 
the land acreage in the State, have been protected through the aforementioned programs 
and other efforts. 
 
The development and publishing of the required plan to meet the State’s conservation 
goals, and associated updates and reporting, can be handled by the Smart Growth 
Subcabinet with existing resources. 
 
Transfer Tax-Funded Programs 
 
Special fund (transfer tax special fund) revenues may be reallocated in fiscal 2025 pursuant 
to the bill to the extent that there are excess revenues collected in fiscal 2023 in comparison 
to the revenue estimates that were used as the basis for the fiscal 2023 appropriations of 
the revenues in the fiscal 2023 budget. The bill requires those excess revenues to be 
allocated to the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Fund in fiscal 2025 instead of, under 
current law, being allocated/appropriated in accordance with the transfer tax formula in 
fiscal 2025. To the extent that reallocation occurs under the bill, funding for the transfer 
tax-funded programs – POS (including State forest and park operations), MALPF, the 
Rural Legacy Program, and the Heritage Conservation Fund – is reduced. 
 
However, it appears unlikely that there will be excess revenues in fiscal 2023. A recent 
estimate of fiscal 2023 transfer tax revenues, in December 2022, was lower than the 
estimated revenues used as the basis for the fiscal 2023 appropriations. The 
December 2022 estimate for fiscal 2023 transfer tax revenues, by the Bureau of Revenue 
Estimates, was $258.5 million, and the December 2021 estimate, which was used as a basis 
for the fiscal 2023 appropriations, was $306.5 million. Because it appears unlikely that 
there will be excess fiscal 2023 transfer tax revenues to be allocated to the Local Land 
Trust Revolving Loan Fund in fiscal 2025, this analysis assumes general funds are needed 
to capitalize the fund, as discussed below.

SB 470/ Page 9 
 
Grant/Loan Programs 
 
 
General Fund Impact 
 
General fund expenditures increase by $6.7 million in fiscal 2025, by $738,573 in 
fiscal 2026, and by ongoing amounts in future years. This estimate reflects the cost of 
(1) hiring one agency grants specialist and one natural resources planner in fiscal 2025 in 
order to administer the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Program; (2) hiring one agency 
grants specialist in fiscal 2025 to administer the 40 x 40 Land Conservation Implementation 
Grant Program and the stewardship grants; (3) capitalizing the Local Land Trust Revolving 
Loan Fund in fiscal 2025 ($6.0 million); and (4) providing annual funding for the  
40 x 40 Land Conservation Implementation Grant Program ($250,000) and the stewardship 
grants ($235,000) beginning in fiscal 2025. The estimate includes salaries, fringe benefits, 
one-time start-up costs, and ongoing operating expenses. It reflects the following 
information and assumptions:   
 
 
The 40 x 40 Land Conservation Implementation Grant Program and the stewardship 
grants are funded in accordance with the authorizations in the bill ($250,000 and 
$235,000, respectively, each fiscal year beginning in fiscal 2025) and $6.0 million 
is appropriated in fiscal 2025 to capitalize the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan 
Fund. As discussed above, it appears unlikely that transfer tax revenues will be 
allocated to the fund in fiscal 2025, and $6.0 million is assumed to be the minimum 
amount of funding needed for the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Program to be 
an effective, viable program. These funding amounts are assumed to be supported 
by general funds in the absence of another funding source.  
 
While the bill takes effect in fiscal 2024, this analysis assumes funding for the 
programs, and the staffing to administer the programs, do not begin until 
fiscal 2025, when funding is first authorized. The authorization for the Governor to 
include an appropriation in the annual budget bill to the Local Land Trust Revolving 
Loan Fund does not specify a fiscal year when the authorization begins, but 
fiscal 2025 is the first fiscal year for which the Governor has an opportunity to 
include funding in the annual budget bill after the bill takes effect. 
 
MET indicates it is not able handle the additional workload of administering the 
grant and loan programs with existing staff. 
 
The natural resources planner starts in fiscal 2025 to absorb the workload of an 
existing natural resources planner involved in easement stewardship that MET 
expects to reassign to supervise the loan program. 
 
Since the bill does not explicitly allow for the Local Land Trust Revolving Loan 
Fund to be used for administrative costs, this analysis assumes that those costs are 
funded with general funds, independent of the special fund.

expenses. 
 
The bill’s criminal penalty provision is not expected to materially affect general fund 
revenues or expenditures. 
 
 
Special Fund Impact – Local Land Trust Revolving Loan Fund 
 
Special fund revenues increase by $6.0 million in fiscal 2025 and by indeterminate amounts 
in future years, reflecting the revolving loan fund’s receipt of general funds and loan 
repayments. It is uncertain how quickly the initial capitalization of the fund will be spent, 
through awarding of loans, but this analysis assumes special fund expenditures increase by 
$3.0 million in each of fiscal 2025 and 2026 and by indeterminate amounts in future years. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  Counties and municipalities are likely affected by and/or participate 
in the goals and programs established by the bill, beginning in fiscal 2025. Local revenues 
and expenditures related to land conservation, and environmental education and 
stewardship, likely increase by an indeterminate amount as a result. 
 
To the extent excess fiscal 2023 transfer tax revenues are reallocated to the Local Land 
Trust Revolving Loan Fund in fiscal 2025, instead of being allocated/appropriated in 
accordance with the transfer tax formula, local funding/grants under POS and the Rural 
Legacy Program are reduced in fiscal 2025. However, as noted above, this appears 
unlikely. 
 
The bill’s criminal penalty provision is not expected to materially affect local government 
revenues or expenditures. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Small businesses that provide services, including appraisals, title 
work, surveys, or other due diligence, for land acquisition projects may meaningfully 
benefit from additional land conservation efforts under the bill. Small businesses in the 

END OF PAGE 10

agricultural and resource-based industries may also benefit to the extent land conservation 
efforts in the State are increased to meet the bill’s land conservation goals.
