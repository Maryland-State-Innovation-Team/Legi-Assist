House Bill 315 
(Delegate Stewart) 
Economic Matters 
 
 
Human Relations - Discrimination in Housing - Income-Based Housing Subsidies 
 
 
This bill prohibits, except as authorized under federal law, a landlord or residential rental 
property that uses financial information (including credit history) as part of a prospective 
tenant’s rental application from refusing to rent to a prospective tenant who pays rent with 
the assistance of an income-based housing subsidy on the basis of the prospective tenant’s 
income, credit score, lack of credit score, or adverse credit history, as specified. The bill 
establishes such an action as a discriminatory housing practice, subject to enforcement by 
the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR). A landlord that receives funding from 
a governmental entity, a quasi-governmental entity, or a nonprofit organization that 
requires income qualification for tenants in income-restricted rental units may collect 
financial information from a prospective tenant if the collection of such information is a 
condition of the funding.

in whole or in part, a tenant’s rent obligation. This includes low‐income housing assistance 
certificates and vouchers issued under the United States Housing Act of 1937. 
 
Current Law:  In general, State law prohibits housing discrimination because of race, sex, 
color, religion, national origin, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, source of income, disability, or military status. Discriminatory housing practices 
include (1) the refusal to rent, sell, or otherwise make available a dwelling; 
(2) discrimination with regard to terms or conditions of sale or rentals of dwellings; and 
(3) discrimination with regard to the making or purchasing of loans or providing other 
financial assistance. Prohibited practices also include retaliation, coercion, intimidation, or 
threats because a person exercises the rights and protections granted by State law to prevent 
discrimination. 
 
Chapters 116 and 117 of 2020 established the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of 
a person’s source of income. “Source of income” is any lawful source of money paid 
directly or indirectly to or on behalf of a renter or buyer of housing, including income from 
(1) any lawful profession, occupation, or job; (2) any government or private assistance, 
grant, loan, or rental assistance program, including low-income housing assistance 
certificates and vouchers; (3) any gift, inheritance, pension, annuity, alimony, child 
support, or other consideration or benefit; and (4) any sale or pledge of property or an 
interest in property. Prohibitions against discrimination based on source of income do not:   
 
 
prohibit a person from determining the ability of a potential buyer or renter to pay a 
purchase price or pay rent by verifying in a commercially reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory manner the source and amount of income or creditworthiness of 
the potential buyer or renter; 
 
prevent a person from refusing to consider income derived from criminal activity; 
or 
 
prohibit a person from determining, in accordance with applicable federal and State 
laws, the ability of a potential buyer to repay a mortgage loan. 
 
A person claiming to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice may file a 
complaint with MCCR. Statutory provisions specify the process and requirements for 
complaints of housing discrimination, including the responsibilities of MCCR in 
investigating a claim and attempting conciliation and the circumstances under which a 
complainant, respondent, or aggrieved person must have an opportunity for an 
administrative hearing conducted by OAH or may elect to file a civil action in circuit court. 
If an administrative law judge (ALJ) finds that the respondent has engaged in a 
discriminatory housing practice, the ALJ may order appropriate relief, including actual 
damages and injunctive or other relief, and may assess a civil penalty against the 
respondent. A court may award actual or punitive damages, grant injunctive relief, and 
allow reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
