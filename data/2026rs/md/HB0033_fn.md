Analysis 
 
Current Law:  The BRFA of 2025 made several changes to the personal income tax for 
tax year 2025 and beyond. Among other things, the Act increases the Maryland standard 
deduction and requires taxpayers with federal AGI in excess of $200,000 ($100,000 if 
married filing separately) to reduce the amount of their otherwise allowable itemized 
deductions by an amount equal to 7.5% of federal AGI in excess of the threshold.

HB 33/ Page 2 
Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code allows a deduction for charitable contributions 
made to a qualified charitable organization within the tax year. The federal One Big 
Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 establishes a floor on individual charitable 
contribution deductions equal to 0.5% of AGI (as specified) for tax years after 2025. 
OBBBA also permanently repeals the Pease limitation (which reduced allowable itemized 
deductions for certain high-income taxpayers) and instead requires individuals with taxable 
income in excess of the threshold for the top marginal federal income tax rate (37%) to 
reduce itemized deductions by an amount that effectively limits the tax benefit of itemized 
deductions to 35%. 
 
Additionally, OBBBA permanently reinstates and expands a partial “below-the-line” 
charitable contribution deduction (deducted after calculation of adjusted gross income) for 
non-itemizers for tax years after 2025. (A similar deduction was previously available for 
tax year 2021 under the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021). The deduction 
is limited to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint returns) and does not flow through to the Maryland 
income tax return. 
 
State/Local Revenues:  State general fund revenues and local income tax revenues 
decrease significantly beginning in fiscal 2027 due to increases in total itemized deductions 
claimed on Maryland personal income tax returns. Exhibit 1 displays the bill’s estimated 
effect on State and local revenues in fiscal 2027 through 2031. As shown in the exhibit, in 
fiscal 2027, State general fund revenues and local income tax revenues decrease by an 
estimated $84.6 million and $41.5 million, respectively, reflecting the effect of tax 
year 2026 and a portion of tax year 2027. Future years reflect annualization and projected 
income growth.

individual deduction statistics for Maryland for tax year 2022 (the most recent year for 
which data is available) published by the Internal Revenue Service. This estimate also 
accounts for the effect of OBBBA’s changes to the federal charitable contribution 
deduction.
