FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
First Reader 
House Bill 168 
(Delegate Vogel) 
Economic Matters 
 
 
Housing and Community Development - Affordable Housing - Educator 
Workforce Housing and Municipal Corporations 
 
 
This bill establishes that developing “educator workforce housing” is an eligible use for 
the proceeds of a loan, grant, tax credit, or other financial support for specified housing 
programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHCD). 
DHCD must notify applicants to those programs that developing educator workforce 
housing is an eligible use of financial support from the State; however, the notification 
requirement does not apply to applications for any DHCD program that does not focus on 
housing. The bill establishes that teachers and other school employees must be considered 
a specified group under the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program 
and other applicable federal programs. Finally, the bill expands the purpose and eligible 
recipients of funding from the Housing Innovation Fund, Housing Innovation Pilot 
Program, and Neighborhood and Community Assistance Program to support the 
development of educator workforce housing. The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  DHCD can implement the bill with existing budgeted resources, as discussed 
below. Revenues are not affected. 
  
Local Effect:  Local school boards and municipal corporations are eligible for funding 
assistance from the State to support the development of educator workforce housing. The 
bill otherwise does not materially affect local government operations or finances. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  “Educator workforce housing” means affordable housing that is reserved 
for teachers or other employees of a local school system. 
 
The bill establishes that it is State policy to support educator workforce housing 
development in Maryland. If the laws or regulations governing a particular program 
affected by the bill establish more specific rules regarding the use of financial support for 
educator workforce housing, the more specific rules must apply. 
 
Providing educator workforce housing is a “school purpose,” so that a local school board 
may not declare any land, school sites, or buildings that it owns as surplus property if they 
can still be used for educator workforce housing. 
 
Changes to Affordable Housing Programs 
 
The bill alters the scope of the Housing Innovation Fund and the Housing Innovation Pilot 
Program, both of which terminate July 1, 2029. 
 
The bill alters the purpose of and potential recipients of funds from the Housing Innovation 
Fund. Specifically, the purpose of the fund is expanded to include providing loans to 
develop educator workforce housing, and the potential recipients are expanded to include 
local boards of education and municipal corporations. Similarly, the bill alters the 
definition of a “housing innovation project” as it relates to the Housing Innovation Fund 
and Pilot Program to include a project to provide educator workforce housing. A project 
may qualify as a housing innovation project if it provides new housing in which any portion 
of the units are set aside for educator workforce housing. 
 
The bill alters the purpose of the Housing Innovation Pilot Program to include municipal 
corporations and county boards of education among the entities for which the program 
(1) creates opportunities for increasing housing production and (2) rewards for pursuing 
innovative solutions to the problem of housing scarcity. 
 
Neighborhood and Community Assistance Program 
 
The bill alters the scope of the Neighborhood and Community Assistance program to 
include providing educator workforce housing. Additionally, the bill requires that any 
project proposed that provides educator workforce housing be approved by the local board 
of education or authorized designee of at least one local school system that stands to benefit 
from the project.

HB 168/ Page 3 
Current Law: 
 
Live Near Your Work Program 
 
The Community Development Administration (CDA) must administer the Live Near Your 
Work home buyer assistance program that (1) assists home buyers to receive low-interest 
mortgage loans, with down payment and closing cost assistance options, for the purchase 
of homes near their workplace and (2) coordinate with, and match where appropriate, 
similar programs offered by private employers and county and municipal governments so 
as to maximize the total amount that home buyers can receive under the program. CDA 
must (1) allow home buyers to use the loans for the purchase of newly constructed or 
existing homes and (2) require a home purchased under the program to be occupied by the 
home buyer as a principal residence. In addition, CDA must facilitate the marketing of the 
program with private employers, county and municipal governments, and, where 
appropriate, other units of State government and nonprofit organizations. 
 
Live Near Your Work Program – Community Development Projects 
 
CDA must administer community development projects that (1) are in sustainable 
communities and (2) provide employees with financial assistance in the form of grants to 
buy homes near their workplaces. A community development project administered 
pursuant to these provisions is not subject to specified provisions that require that part of 
the housing be occupied by families of limited income. 
 
Housing Innovation Fund 
 
The Housing Innovation Fund is a special, nonlapsing fund administered by DHCD. The 
purpose of the fund is to provide loans for local housing authorities and county 
governments to develop mixed-income, cross-subsidized housing. The fund consists of 
money appropriated in the State budget to the fund and any other money from any other 
source accepted for the benefit of the fund. The fund may be used only to provide low- or 
no-interest loans to local housing authorities or to county governments partnering with 
housing developers through the Housing Innovation Pilot Program. In addition, the fund 
may be used for projects where a county, in conjunction with a local housing authority or 
a housing developer, acquires existing private sector housing. The fund terminates  
June 30, 2029. 
 
Housing Innovation Pilot Program 
 
“Housing innovation project” means a project to provide mixed-income, cross-subsidized 
housing that meets specified criteria. “Public ownership” means that the housing authority 
of the political subdivision of the State in which the project is located possesses majority 
ownership or control.

HB 168/ Page 4 
The purposes of the Housing Innovation Pilot Program are to create opportunities for the 
State’s housing authorities and county governments to increase the volume of housing 
production and to reward counties pursuing innovative solutions to the problem of housing 
scarcity. The program must be operated with money in the Housing Innovation Fund. A 
project qualifies as a housing innovation project if it provides new housing in which (1) at 
least 20% of the units are set aside for households with a gross annual income of not more 
than 50% of the area median income for a household of a like size or (2) at least 40% of 
the units are set aside for households with a gross annual income of not more than 60% of 
the area median income for a household of like size. 
 
DHCD must prioritize funding for projects in which (1) the project does not use LIHTC 
equity or tax-exempt volume cap; (2) the specified affordable set-asides remain restricted 
at elected levels for at least 99 years; (3) the project remains in public ownership; and 
(4) the project includes a commitment to prevailing wage requirements. 
 
DHCD must (1) coordinate with local housing authorities and county governments to 
ensure access to other financial resources, including senior debt products; (2) develop new 
resources in support of statewide housing production; (3) solicit applicants for the program; 
and (4) select three projects to receive assistance from the program each in a different 
jurisdiction. DHCD may select fewer than three projects to fund if there is an insufficient 
number of eligible applicants. 
 
In administering the program, DHCD must take into consideration the need for increased 
development capacity within local housing authorities. DHCD may not condition the award 
of funding from the program on the issuance of bonds by DHCD. The program terminates 
June 30, 2029. 
 
Neighborhood and Community Assistance Program 
 
The purposes of DHCD’s Neighborhood and Community Assistance Program are to 
(1) help nonprofit organizations carry out approved projects in priority funding areas; 
(2) encourage business entities to invest in priority funding areas; and (3) strengthen 
partnerships between public and private entities. 
 
For each fiscal year, a nonprofit organization may submit to DHCD, for approval under the 
program, a proposal for a project to provide services to a priority funding area. The project 
may include community services, redevelopment assistance, job training for low-income 
individuals, education, and crime prevention. The proposal must include specified 
information, including the project to be conducted, the priority funding area that will 
benefit from the project, and the estimated project costs, among other things. A proposal 
must be approved by the local jurisdiction in which the priority funding area is located 
before DHCD may approve it. However, if a local jurisdiction does not respond within 
45 days of receiving notice of the proposal, DHCD may approve the proposal.

HB 168/ Page 5 
In considering a proposal and in determining the maximum amount of contributions 
eligible for tax credits, DHCD must consider relevant factors, including the need for the 
project, the anticipated benefit to the priority funding area, the applicant’s ability to 
successfully complete the project, and the geographic distribution of projects, among other 
things. DHCD may give preference to a proposal that benefits a sustainable community 
designated by DHCD’s Business Development Program or a neighborhood conservation 
district designated under the program. DHCD may also request data and assistance from 
other units of the State in approving or disapproving a proposal and in determining eligible 
amounts. 
 
An individual or a business entity may claim a nonrefundable tax credit against the income 
tax, insurance premium tax, or public service company franchise tax for a contribution 
worth more than $500 in goods, money, or real property to an approved project under the 
Neighborhood and Community Assistance Program. The tax credit is equal to 50% of the 
amount of approved contributions made during the tax year, up to $250,000. Any excess 
credit, including any amount that would be allowed but for the $250,000 limit, may be 
carried forward for up to five tax years. DHCD administers the tax credit application, 
approval, and certification process. The sum of contributions eligible for the tax credit may 
not exceed $3,500,000 for all approved projects for a fiscal year. 
 
Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credit – Generally 
 
LIHTC provides an incentive for the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental 
housing. These nonrefundable federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of 
qualified rental projects via a competitive application process administered by state 
housing finance authorities. LIHTCs are first allocated to each state according to its 
population. State housing agencies allocate credits to developers of rental housing 
according to federally required, but state created, Qualified Allocation Plans (QAPs). 
Federal law requires that the QAP give priority to projects that serve the lowest income 
households and that remain affordable for the longest period of time. 
 
Authority for Local School Boards to Dispose of Surplus Property 
 
With the approval of the State Superintendent or designee, if a local school board finds that 
any land, school site, or building is no longer needed for school purposes, it must inform 
the county commissioners or county council of its determination. The county then has right 
of first refusal to the surplus property for 30 days. If the county finds that the property is 
an integral component of an existing economic development plan, the local school board 
must transfer the property to the county, as specified. If the county has no need for the 
property, the local school board may dispose of the property according to procedures in 
State law.

HB 168/ Page 6 
State Expenditures:  DHCD advises that it requires two additional staff to implement the 
provisions of the bill, but the Department of Legislative Services (DLS) disagrees. 
 
DHCD advises that the bill creates new and ongoing responsibilities that require 
one CDA Program Manager to amend DHCD’s QAPs and make other updates to LIHTC 
required by the bill. Additionally, DHCD further advises that the bill creates the need for 
one Financial Analyst IV to process and administer loans, grants, and other applicable 
payments authorized by the bill. 
 
DLS disagrees, as additional responsibilities for DHCD under the bill are limited. The bill 
expands the eligible use of existing programs (some of which terminate in two years) and 
does not create new funding requirements or funding streams. While the bill requires 
DHCD to reclassify QAPs, DLS believes this can be done with existing budgeted 
resources. Therefore, the bill is not anticipated to materially affect State operations of 
finances. 
 
Additional Comments:  DHCD advises that the provision designating teachers and other 
employees of a local school system as a specific group with respect to LIHTC conflicts 
with Internal Revenue Code regulations requiring public input to shape the populations 
targeted by LIHTC.
