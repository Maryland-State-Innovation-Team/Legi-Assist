2 SENATE BILL 678

1 (1) the forensic genetic genealogical DNA analysis of biological material
2 using SNP or other sequencing techniques to develop an FGG profile;

3 (2) a subsequent search using the FGG profile in a publicly available open–
4 data personal genomics database or a direct–to–consumer genetic genealogy service to find
5 individuals related to the source of the FGG profile; and

6 (3) a genealogical search using public records and other lawful means to
7 obtain information in accordance with this title.

8 (f) (1) “Forensic sample” means biological material reasonably believed by
9 investigators to have been deposited by a putative perpetrator and that was collected from
10 a crime scene or a person, an item, or a location connected to the criminal event.

11 (2) “Forensic sample” includes biological material from unidentified
12 human remains.

13 (h) “Putative perpetrator” means one or more criminal actors reasonably believed
14 by investigators to have committed the crime under investigation and to be the source of,
15 or a contributor to, a forensic sample deposited during or incident to the commission of a
16 crime.

17 (i) “Reasonable investigative leads” means credible, case–specific facts,
18 information, or circumstances that would lead a reasonably cautious investigator to believe
19 that the pursuit would have a fair probability of identifying a putative perpetrator.

20 (l) “STR DNA profile” means a genetic profile that examines genetic locations on
21 the non–sex chromosomes that are used for the statewide DNA database system or the
22 national DNA database system.

23 17–102.

24 (a) (1) FGGS may not be initiated without judicial authorization and without
25 certifying before the court that the forensic sample and the criminal case satisfy the criteria
26 set forth in this section.

27 (2) If an FGGS is certified before a court in accordance with this section,
28 the court shall authorize the initiation of the FGGS.

29 (b) (1) A sworn affidavit shall be submitted by a law enforcement agent with
30 approval of a prosecutor from the relevant jurisdiction asserting that:

SENATE BILL 678 3

1 (ii) the crime is the commission of, or the attempt to commit, murder,
2 rape, a felony sexual offense, or a criminal act involving circumstances presenting a
3 substantial and ongoing threat to public safety or national security;

4 (iii) the forensic sample to be subjected to the FGGS is biological
5 material reasonably believed by investigators to have been deposited by a putative
6 perpetrator and that the forensic sample was collected from:

7 1. a crime scene;

8 2. a person, an item, or a location connected to the criminal
9 event; or

10 3. the unidentified human remains of a suspected homicide
11 victim;

12 (iv) 1. an STR DNA profile has already been developed from the
13 forensic sample, was entered into the statewide DNA database system and the national
14 DNA database system, and failed to identify a known individual; OR

15 2. A. AN EVIDENTIARY DNA PROFILE SUITABLE FOR
16 DIRECT COMPARISON HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED FROM THE FORENSIC
17 SAMPLE, FAILED TO IDENTIFY A KNOWN INDIVIDUAL, AND WAS NOT ABLE TO BE
18 ENTERED INTO THE STATEWIDE DNA DATABASE SYSTEM OR NATIONAL DNA
19 DATABASE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE DNA PROFILE FAILED TO MEET TIER
20 REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS CORE LOCUS CRITERIA, FOR ENTRY INTO CODIS; AND

21 B. AT LEAST 15 YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE CRIME
22 BEING INVESTIGATED WAS COMMITTED; and

23 (v) unless the crime being investigated presents an ongoing threat
24 to public safety or national security concerns, reasonable investigative leads have been
25 pursued and failed to identify the perpetrator.

26 (2) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to require that all
27 investigative leads have been exhausted.

28 SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
29 October 1, 2026.
