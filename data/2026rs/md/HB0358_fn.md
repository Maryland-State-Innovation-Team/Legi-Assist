Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill exempts, from the State sales and use tax, sales made by an 
elementary or secondary school, nonprofit parent-teacher organization, or other nonprofit 
organization within an elementary or secondary school if the sale is made at a book fair 
held in-person on the premises of the school and the net proceeds are used solely for the 
educational benefit of the school or its students. The tax exemption also includes a sale 
resulting from an agreement or a contract with an organization to participate in a book fair 
for a percentage of the gross receipts under which students, teachers, school staff, or 
members of the parent-teacher organization or other nonprofit organization within an 
elementary or secondary school act as agents or salespersons for the third-party vendor by 
managing the book fair.

State Sales and Use Tax 
 
According to the December 2025 revenue forecast, the sales and use tax is the State’s 
second largest source of general fund revenue, accounting for approximately $6.1 billion 
in fiscal 2026 and $6.2 billion in fiscal 2027. The current tax rate is 6.0%. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  State revenues decrease by an indeterminate amount beginning in 
fiscal 2027. The total revenue decrease depends on the number of school book fairs that 
take place each year and the amount of sales at these events. Information is not currently 
available on the total magnitude of school book fairs in Maryland, since the lead third-party 
vendor for such events (Scholastic Corporation) does not report the breakdown of sales at 
the state level. However, information is available from recent book fairs at two elementary 
schools in Montgomery County. Recent book fairs held at Rachel Carson Elementary 
School in Gaithersburg have averaged $22,400 in sales over the past four events, while 
Bethesda Elementary School had sales totaling approximately $20,000 at one event  
last year. Based on the current 6.0% State sales tax rate, the proposed tax exemption would 
have resulted in a $1,344 revenue loss at the book fair at Rachel Carson Elementary School 
and a $1,200 revenue loss at Bethesda Elementary School.

HB 358/ Page 3 
Based on one set of assumptions, the potential revenue loss from the proposed sales tax 
exemption could total approximately $150,000 annually statewide. This estimate is based 
on 500 school book fairs taking place each year with average sales of $5,000 at each school. 
 
According to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), there are 
approximately 1,400 elementary and secondary schools in the State, of which around 1,000 
are elementary and middle schools. This estimate assumes that 50% of public elementary 
and middle schools will conduct a book fair each year. 
 
MSDE also reports that approximately 51.0% of public school students are approved for 
free and reduced-price meals (FRPM) which is one approach to measure the family income 
levels of public school students and their ability to purchase items at a school sponsored 
book fair. The FRPM count as a percent of student enrollment ranges from 27.8% in 
Calvert County to 86.8% in Baltimore City. Three local school systems (Baltimore City, 
Caroline County, and Somerset County) have over 70% of their students approved for 
FRPM. Due to the variations in the family incomes across Maryland, potential book sales 
may be significantly lower in certain public schools. Due to this reason, this estimate 
assumes that the average sales from school book fairs will be lower than the current 
experience in Montgomery County.
