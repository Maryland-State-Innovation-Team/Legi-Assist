incarceration at a State correctional facility in the immediately preceding week. On receipt 
of the list, SBE must (1) identify each individual on the list who was registered to vote in 
the State before being incarcerated and whose new residential address is located in the State 
and (2) automatically restore the voter registration of such individuals at their new 
residential address and give them active voter status. Irrespective of the Public Information 
Act, the bill prohibits public disclosure of the fact that a particular voter was registered 
through DPSCS pursuant to the bill.  
 
Notice of Registration 
 
The bill also requires the election director of a local board of elections to enclose a notice 
with each voter notification card sent to individuals whose voter registration has been 
restored (a voter notification card is sent to a voter as evidence of voter registration) that 
includes a statement that (1) the individual has been registered to vote at the residential 
address the individual provided to a State agency; (2) the individual is eligible to vote in 
the State in all federal, State, and local elections; and (3) if the individual wishes to decline 
voter registration, or if the individual needs to update the individual’s residential address, 
the individual should contact SBE or the appropriate local board. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Voter Qualifications 
 
Under State law, with certain exceptions, an individual may register to vote if the individual 
is a citizen of the United States, is at least age 16, and is a resident of the State as of the 
day the individual seeks to register. A person who has been convicted of a felony and is 
currently serving a court-ordered sentence of imprisonment for the conviction is not 
qualified to be a registered voter. 
 
Reports on Individuals Convicted of a Felony and Sentenced to Imprisonment 
 
Each month, the clerk of the circuit court for each county and the administrative clerk for 
each District Court must report to the State Administrator of Elections the names and 
addresses of all individuals convicted, in the respective court, of a felony and sentenced to 
imprisonment with commitment papers. The information must be reported in a format and 
at times prescribed by SBE. In addition, the State Administrator must make arrangements 
with the clerk of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland to receive reports of 
names and addresses, if available, of individuals convicted of a felony in that court and 
sentenced to imprisonment with commitment papers.

Voting Information/Material Provided to Released Individuals 
 
DPSCS must (1) provide each individual who is released from a correctional facility with 
a voter registration application and documentation with the individual’s discharge papers 
that informs the individual that the individual’s voting rights have been restored; (2) display 
a sign in each parole and probation office, in a conspicuous location where notices to the 
public are customarily posted, indicating that any individual who is no longer incarcerated 
has the right to vote; and (3) post a notice, in a conspicuous location on the department’s 
website, indicating that any individual who is no longer incarcerated has the right to vote. 
 
Voter Registration 
 
An individual may apply to become a registered voter through a number of means including  
(1) visiting an election board office; (2) by mail; (3) when applying for services at a voter 
registration agency (specified public and nongovernmental agencies designated by SBE, 
including agencies providing public assistance and services for individuals with 
disabilities, public higher education institutions, military recruiting offices, and 
one-stop career centers in the Maryland Department of Labor); (4) during an applicable 
transaction at automatic voter registration agencies, which are the Motor Vehicle 
Administration, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, local departments of social 
services, and the Mobility Certification Office in the Maryland Transit Administration; 
(5) through SBE’s online voter registration system; or (6) at an early voting center or an 
election day polling place in their county of residence. 
 
Voter Notification 
 
The election director in the county where a voter registration applicant resides must send a 
voter acknowledgment notice, in a format prescribed by SBE, to each applicant informing 
them whether he or she is qualified to become registered and, if not qualified, the reasons 
why.  
 
A voter notification card sent to a qualified applicant may serve as a voter acknowledgment 
notice. The voter notification card must contain the name and address of the voter, the date 
of issue, and the district or ward and precinct of the voter. SBE regulations also require that 
the registered voter’s party affiliation, if any, and name and address of the appropriate 
polling place be included on the card. The card is evidence that the individual to whom it 
is issued is a registered voter on the date appearing on the card. The election director must 
issue a replacement card on request of the voter and a new card when a relevant change is 
made in the voter’s registration record if the voter continues to reside in the county. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  Local government expenditures increase, collectively, by 
$400,000 in fiscal 2027 only which accounts for the bill’s January 1, 2027 effective date,

for one-time development costs billed to the local boards of elections by SBE, in 
accordance with the State’s current cost-sharing structure with the local boards, for 
modifications in the statewide voter registration system. SBE advises that these 
modifications are needed to (1) implement new functionality enabling the reactivation of 
cancelled registrations based on external source data and (2) make changes to the voter 
notification card (generated through the voter registration system) to include the 
information required under the bill.  
 
The existing voter registration system is scheduled to be replaced prior to the 
2030 elections and SBE expects that the bill’s requirements can be integrated into the new 
system at no additional cost.
