2 (3) “Certified SREC” means a solar renewable energy credit generated by
3 a certified system.

4 (4) “Certified system” means a solar energy generating system certified by
5 the Commission under the Program to generate certified SRECs with the compliance value
6 specified in subsection (c) of this section.

7 (5) “Program” means the Small Solar Energy Generating System Incentive

9 (d) To be eligible for certification under the Program, a solar energy generating
10 system shall:

11 (1) be located in the State;

12 (2) be eligible for inclusion in meeting the renewable energy portfolio
13 standard;

14 (3) have a generating capacity of 5 megawatts or less, as measured by the
15 alternating current rating of the system’s inverter;

16 (4) be placed in service between July 1, 2024, and January 1, [2028] 2031,
17 inclusive; and

18 (5) be one of the following types of systems:

19 (i) a system with a generating capacity of 20 kilowatts or less, as
20 measured by the alternating current rating of the system’s inverter;

21 (ii) a system with a generating capacity of 2 megawatts or less, as
22 measured by the alternating current rating of the system’s inverter, if the system is used
23 for aggregate net metering; or

24 (iii) a system with a generating capacity of between 20 kilowatts and
25 5 megawatts, as measured by the alternating current rating of the system’s inverter, if the
