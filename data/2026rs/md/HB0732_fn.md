Analysis 
 
Current Law:  The Baltimore County Code is legalized approximately every ten years. 
Chapter 159 of 2015 legalized the 2015 Edition of the Baltimore County Code,  
Chapter 251 of 2004 legalized the 2003 Edition of the Baltimore County Code, and  
Chapter 6 of 1990 legalized the 1988 Edition of the Baltimore County Code. 
 
Baltimore County is 1 of 11 counties that operates under the charter form of government. 
Charter counties have express powers delegated to them by the General Assembly.  
Charter counties do not need to seek General Assembly approval for changes to local laws 
except laws regarding alcoholic beverages, courts, criminal law, education, campaign 
finance regulation, gambling, and taxation exclusive of property taxes. However, legalizing 
changes enacted by the General Assembly to the new edition of the county code and any 
supplement must receive approval of the General Assembly.
