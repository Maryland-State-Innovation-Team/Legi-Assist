FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
First Reader 
House Bill 559 
(Delegate Edelson, et al.) 
Appropriations and Environment and 
Transportation 
 
 
Transportation - Highway User Revenues Capital Grants - Calculation 
 
 
This bill increases, beginning in fiscal 2028, the amount of funds from the Gasoline and 
Motor Vehicle Revenue Account (GMVRA) that the Maryland Department of 
Transportation (MDOT) must annually provide to local governments through capital 
transportation 
grants 
by 
making 
permanent 
the 
distribution 
required 
for  
fiscal 2026 and 2027. The bill takes effect July 1, 2026.   
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Because MDOT’s capital program is fully subscribed, overall Transportation 
Trust Fund (TTF) expenditures are not affected. However, over the five‑year period 
addressed in this fiscal and policy note, relative to current law, the bill requires MDOT to 
redirect an estimated $96.3 million in FY 2028, $98.8 million in FY 2029, $101.6 million 
in FY 2030 and $104.4 million in FY 2031 to local governments. 
  
Local Effect:  Over the five-year period addressed in this fiscal and policy note, relative 
to current law, local government revenues increase (in total) by an estimated $96.3 million 
in FY 2028, $98.8 million in FY 2029, $101.6 million in FY 2030 and $104.4 million in 
FY 2031. Expenditures are not directly affected. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Minimal or none. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law:  Under current law, TTF provides local transportation aid 
through GMVRA, and revenues in the account are commonly referred to as highway user 
revenues. Currently, the revenues dedicated to the account include all or some portion of

the motor vehicle fuel tax, vehicle titling tax, vehicle registration fees, short-term vehicle 
rental tax, and State corporate income tax. GMVRA revenues are distributed to local 
governments through capital transportation grants. 
 
The amount of the grants that MDOT must annually provide to local governments from 
GMVRA is based on a statutory formula which was last modified by Chapter 240 of 2022. 
Exhibit 1 shows the distribution of GMVRA revenues required beginning in fiscal 2028 
under both current law and the bill. Notably, the bill makes permanent the distribution 
required for fiscal 2026 and 2027 pursuant to Chapter 240.

State Fiscal Effect:  Altering the GMVRA distribution formula beginning in fiscal 2028 
decreases MDOT’s share of highway user revenues and increases the local share of 
highway user revenues provided through capital transportation grants. 
 
Because MDOT’s capital program is fully subscribed, MDOT must redirect capital funding 
from other projects to provide the additional capital transportation grants to local 
governments. Relative to current law and based on the estimated funds credited to 
GMVRA, the bill requires MDOT to redirect $96.3 million in fiscal 2028, $98.8 million in 
fiscal 2029, $101.6 million in fiscal 2030, and $104.4 million in fiscal 2031 (totaling 
approximately $401.1 million over the five-year period addressed in this fiscal and policy 
note) to local governments.
