5 megawatt–hour of renewable electricity generation. [RECs] CECS may be sold separately
6 from renewable electricity itself. Renewable electricity and [RECs] CECS may be sold to
7 different entities. The purchase of a [REC] CEC does not indicate that renewable
8 electricity itself has been purchased by the entity that purchased the [REC] CEC.”.

9 (g) In addition to the disclosure required under subsection (f) of this section, the
