Agricultural Land Transfer Tax 
 
Subject to specified exemptions, an agricultural land transfer tax is imposed on an 
instrument of writing that transfers title to agricultural land. A portion of the tax is retained 
by the county in which it was collected and a portion is remitted to the Comptroller. 
Included among the revenue remitted to the State is all of the agricultural land transfer tax 
revenue generated from land that is entirely woodland. Up to $200,000 of the revenue from 
woodland transfers and from a separate surcharge imposed on an instrument of writing that 
transfers title to agricultural land is deposited in MNWIFF each year.
