House Bill 404 
(Delegate Mireku-North) 
Environment and Transportation 
 
 
Natural Resources - State Parks - Terminology 
 
  
This bill changes (1) certain references to “State historical parks” in provisions enacted 
under Chapter 39 of 2022 (Great Maryland Outdoors Act) to simply refer to “State parks” 
and (2) references to two specific parks required to be established under Chapter 39 – 
“Freedman’s State Historical Park” and “Port of Deposit State Historical Park” – to refer 
instead to “Freedman’s State Park” and “Port Deposit State Park.” Despite the bill’s 
removal of the word “historical” from those references, the historical nature and purpose 
of the parks expressed in statute is not changed.

Recreation Commission, and with input from groups active in the preservation of 
historical sites of underrepresented communities; and

Chapter 39 also authorizes DNR to enter into a memorandum of understanding or 
partnership agreement with a local government, bicounty agency, or nonprofit organization 
to establish or manage a “partnership park” and requires the department to establish 
Freedman’s State Historical Park (in northeastern Montgomery County) and the Port of 
Deposit State Historical Park (in western Cecil County) as partnership parks that seek to 
educate the public about and preserve and interpret the lives and experiences of 
Black Americans both before and after the abolition of slavery.  
 
State Park System – In General 
 
The State park system is administered under the jurisdiction of DNR’s Maryland Park
