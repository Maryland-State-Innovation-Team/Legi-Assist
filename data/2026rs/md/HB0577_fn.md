Analysis 
 
Bill Summary: 
 
Exceptions:  The bill makes corresponding changes to existing exceptions contained in 
Title 4, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article to account for machine gun convertible 
pistols and expands the exceptions to establish that the bill’s provisions do not apply to: 
 
 
the temporary transfer of a machine gun convertible pistol to a licensed regulated 
firearms dealer or gunsmith for the purpose of servicing the machine gun 
convertible pistol; 
 
the receipt of a machine gun convertible pistol by a licensed regulated firearms 
dealer or gunsmith for the purpose of servicing the machine gun convertible pistol 
and the return of the machine gun convertible pistol to its lawful owner by a licensed 
regulated firearms dealer or gunsmith on the completion of servicing the machine 
gun convertible pistol; or 
 
the receipt of a machine gun convertible pistol by a law enforcement unit, barracks, 
or station, a state or local law enforcement agency, or a federally licensed firearms 
dealer if the person is surrendering the firearm. 
 
Definitions:  “Machine gun convertible pistol” means any semiautomatic pistol with a 
cruciform trigger bar that can be readily converted by hand or by using common household 
tools into a machine gun by the installation or attachment of a pistol converter as a 
replacement for the slide’s backplate without any additional engineering, machining, or 
modification of the pistol’s trigger mechanism. “Machine gun convertible pistol” includes 
a pistol with a cruciform trigger bar and a polymer notch or other piece of polymer molded 
into the rear of the pistol frame where a pistol converter can be attached or installed. 
“Machine gun convertible pistol” does not include a hammer-fired semiautomatic pistol or 
a striker-fired semiautomatic pistol without a cruciform trigger bar, which instead has a 
trigger bar that is shielded from interference by a pistol converter. 
 
“Pistol converter” means any device or instrument that, when installed in or attached to the 
rear of the slide of a semiautomatic pistol, replaces the backplate and interferes with the 
trigger mechanism, which enables the pistol to shoot automatically more than one shot by 
a single function of the trigger. “Pistol converter” includes a pistol converter manufactured 
using a three-dimensional printer.

HB 577/ Page 3 
that title. The Firearm Safety Act of 2013 (Chapter 427) modified and expanded the 
regulation of firearms, firearms dealers, and ammunition in Maryland and made changes 
to related mental health restrictions on the possession of firearms. Among other things, the 
Act extended the scope of assault pistol prohibitions to all assault weapons, created a new 
licensing scheme for handguns under the authority of DSP, and imposed restrictions on the 
capacity of detachable magazines and ammunition. 
 
Assault Weapons and Rapid Fire Activators 
 
Among its many provisions, the Firearm Safety Act of 2013 created a definition of “assault 
weapon,” encompassing assault pistols, assault long guns, and copycat weapons. The Act 
applied existing prohibitions relating to assault pistols to all assault weapons. With 
specified exceptions, transporting, possessing, selling, offering to sell, transferring, 
purchasing, or receiving any assault weapon is prohibited. A violator is guilty of a 
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to three years and/or a $5,000 maximum 
fine. 
 
Generally, prohibitions contained in Title 4, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article (to 
which the bill is drafted) do not apply to: 
 
 
if acting within the scope of official business, personnel of the United States 
government or a unit of that government, members of the Armed Forces of the 
United States or of the National Guard, law enforcement personnel of the State or a 
local unit in the State, or a railroad police officer, as specified; 
 
a firearm modified to render it permanently inoperative; 
 
possession, importation, manufacture, receipt for manufacture, shipment for 
manufacture, storage, purchases, sales, and transport to or by a licensed firearms 
dealer or manufacturer who is (1) providing or servicing an assault weapon or 
detachable magazine for an exempted law enforcement unit or for exempted 
personnel; (2) acting to sell or transfer an assault weapon or detachable magazine to 
a licensed firearm dealer in another state or to an individual purchaser in another 
state through a licensed firearms dealer; or (3) acting to return to a customer in 
another state an assault weapon transferred to the licensed firearms dealer or 
manufacturer under the terms of a warranty or for repair; 
 
organizations that are required or authorized by federal law governing their specific 
business or activity to maintain assault weapons and applicable ammunition and 
detachable magazines; 
 
the receipt of an assault weapon or detachable magazine by inheritance, and 
possession of the inherited assault weapon or detachable magazine, if the decedent 
lawfully possessed the assault weapon or detachable magazine and the person 
inheriting the assault weapon or detachable magazine is not otherwise disqualified 
from possessing a regulated firearm; 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
HB 577/ Page 4 
 
the receipt of an assault weapon or detachable magazine by a personal representative 
of an estate for purposes of exercising the powers and duties of a personal 
representative of an estate; 
 
possession by a person who is retired in good standing from service with a law 
enforcement agency of the State or a local unit in the State and is not otherwise 
prohibited from receiving an assault weapon or detachable magazine if (1) the 
assault weapon or detachable magazine is sold or transferred to the person by the 
law enforcement agency on retirement or (2) the assault weapon or detachable 
magazine was purchased or obtained by the person for official use with the law 
enforcement agency before retirement; 
 
possession or transport by an employee of an armored car company if the individual 
is acting within the scope of employment and has a permit issued, as specified; or 
 
possession, receipt, and testing by, or shipping to or from (1) an  
ISO 17025 accredited, National Institute of Justice-approved ballistics testing 
laboratory or (2) a facility or entity that manufactures or provides research and 
development testing, analysis, or engineering for personal protective equipment or 
vehicle protection systems. 
 
In addition, a person who lawfully possessed an assault pistol before June 1, 1994, and who 
registered the pistol with DSP before August 1, 1994, may continue to possess and 
transport the assault pistol. A person who lawfully possessed, had a purchase order for, or 
completed an application to purchase an assault long gun or a copycat weapon before 
October 1, 2013, is allowed to continue to possess and transport the weapon. A licensed 
firearms dealer may continue to possess, sell, offer for sale, or transfer an assault long gun 
or a copycat weapon that the dealer lawfully possessed on or before October 1, 2013. 
Chapter 427 also clarified when the inheritance of a prohibited assault weapon is permitted. 
 
A person who uses an assault weapon, a rapid fire activator, or a magazine that has a 
capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition in the commission of a felony or a crime 
of violence (as defined in § 5-101 of the Public Safety Article) is guilty of a misdemeanor 
and, in addition to any other sentence imposed for the felony or crime of violence, must be 
sentenced as follows: 
 
 
for a first violation, a nonsuspendable, nonparolable, mandatory minimum sentence 
of 5 years with a maximum imprisonment of 20 years; and 
 
for each subsequent violation, a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years with a 
maximum imprisonment of 20 years (the sentence imposed must be consecutive to 
and not concurrent with any other sentence imposed for the underlying felony or 
crime of violence).

HB 577/ Page 5 
A person may not manufacture, sell, offer for sale, purchase, receive, or transfer a 
detachable magazine that has a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition for a 
firearm. In addition, a person may not (1) transport a rapid fire activator into the State or 
(2) manufacture, possess, sell, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, or receive a rapid fire 
activator. A violator of either provision is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is 
subject to maximum penalties of imprisonment for three years and/or a $5,000 fine. 
 
A person may continue to possess a rapid fire activator if, among other things, the person 
(1) possessed the rapid fire activator before October 1, 2018; (2) applied to the federal 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives before October 1, 2018, for 
authorization to possess a rapid fire activator; (3) received authorization to possess a rapid 
fire activator from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives before 
October 1, 2019; and (4) is in compliance with all federal requirements for possession of a 
rapid fire activator. 
 
Nothing in the provisions pertaining to rapid fire activators under § 4-305.1 of the 
Criminal Law Article is intended to prohibit the otherwise lawful possession of a part or 
combination of parts by (1) a police officer or other person employed by a law enforcement 
agency under circumstances in which the officer or other person possesses the part or parts 
in accordance with authorization given by the law enforcement agency or (2) a person who 
has registered a machine gun with the Secretary of State Police, as specified, if the part or 
parts are possessed for use in only, and necessary for the proper function of, a machine gun 
that is currently registered by the person, as specified. 
 
“Rapid fire activator” means any device, including a removable manual or power-driven 
activating device, constructed so that, when installed in or attached to a firearm (1) the rate 
at which the trigger is activated increases or (2) the rate of fire increases. “Rapid fire 
activator” includes a bump stock, trigger crank, hellfire trigger, binary trigger system, burst 
trigger system, switch/auto-sear, or a copy or a similar device, regardless of the producer 
or manufacturer, but does not include a semiautomatic replacement trigger that improves 
the performance and functionality over the stock trigger. 
 
“Switch/auto-sear” means a device that applies force to a firearm’s trigger bar to prevent it 
from limiting the weapon to firing only one round each time the trigger is depressed. 
 
Machine Guns 
 
Title 4 of the Criminal Law Article contains provisions relating to the use or possession of 
a firearm, including prohibitions pertaining to machine guns. Among other restrictions, the 
Uniform Machine Gun Act requires a person who acquires a machine gun to register the 
machine gun with the Secretary of State Police within 24 hours after acquiring the machine 
gun and in each succeeding year during the month of May. In addition, the Act prohibits a 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 577/ Page 6 
person from using or possessing a machine gun in the commission or attempted 
commission of a crime of violence (as defined in § 4-401 of the Criminal Law Article). 
Violators are guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. The Act 
also prohibits a person from possessing or using a machine gun for an offensive or 
aggressive purpose. Possession or use of a machine gun is presumed to be for an offensive 
or aggressive purpose if, among other things, the machine gun is in the possession of, or 
used by, an unnaturalized foreign-born person or a person who has been convicted of a 
crime of violence in any state or federal court of the United States. Violators are guilty of 
a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years. “Machine gun” means a 
loaded or unloaded weapon that is capable of automatically discharging more than one shot 
or bullet from a magazine by a single function of the firing device. 
 
Small Business Effect:  The bill may have a meaningful impact on small businesses with 
firearms licenses to the extent that they are unable to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, 
purchase, receive, or transfer convertible pistols or pistol converters as a result of the bill.
