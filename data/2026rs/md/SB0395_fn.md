Peer-to-Peer Car Sharing Programs - Insurance and Liability 
 
 
This bill makes various changes to the regulatory framework governing the liability 
requirements (i.e., car insurance) for peer-to-peer car sharing programs. Broadly, the bill 
(1) repeals provisions of current law specifying which insurance coverage is primary when 
a vehicle is being used for a peer-to-peer car sharing program; (2) repeals provisions of 
current law that prohibit an insurer from denying, canceling, voiding, terminating, 
rescinding, or nonrenewing a policy solely on the basis that a motor vehicle covered by the 
policy has been made available through a peer-to-peer car sharing program; (3) authorizes 
part or all of the motor vehicle liability insurance covering a vehicle while it is being used 
for peer-to-peer car sharing to be provided by a shared vehicle driver; (4) includes 
specifications for accidents and incidents that occur in another state during a car sharing 
period; (5) authorizes a peer-to-peer car sharing program to transfer monetary liability and 
charge drivers for any toll, fee, charge, or fine imposed during a car sharing period, as 
specified; and (6) clarifies that a peer-to-peer car sharing program is not liable for a citation 
issued through a traffic control signal monitoring (red light camera) system. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Minimal increase in special fund revenues for the Maryland Insurance

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary: 
 
Primary Coverage for Peer-to-peer Car Sharing Vehicles 
 
The bill repeals various provisions of law that generally require an insurance policy sold 
in connection with, and incidental to, a peer-to-peer car sharing program agreement to be 
primary to any other valid and collectible coverage that may apply to the motor vehicle. 
As a result of these changes, there is no statutory requirement defining which insurance 
coverage must be primary for a vehicle being used in a peer-to-peer car sharing program. 
 
Exclusion of Coverage for Peer-to-peer Car Sharing Vehicles 
 
The bill repeals an existing prohibition that disallows an insurer from denying, canceling, 
voiding, terminating, rescinding, or nonrenewing a personal motor vehicle liability 
insurance policy of a shared vehicle owner solely on the basis that a motor vehicle covered 
under the policy has been made available for sharing through a peer-to-peer car sharing 
program. The bill also repeals a related provision that specifies the circumstances under 
which an insurer could take any such action. 
 
The bill specifies that the provisions of law governing peer-to-peer car sharing programs 
do not invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in a motor vehicle liability insurance 
policy, including an insurance policy in use or approved for use that excludes coverage for 
motor vehicles made available for rent, sharing, or hire or for a business use. 
 
Insurance for Shared Motor Vehicles 
 
The bill authorizes part or all of the motor vehicle liability insurance covering a motor 
vehicle while it is being used for peer-to-peer car sharing to be provided by a shared vehicle 
driver. The bill makes a series of conforming changes to ensure that a driver’s personal 
motor liability insurance policy may be considered primary (meaning it pays out first in 
the event of an accident) during any car sharing period instead of only during a car sharing 
period in which the shared vehicle is being used as a replacement vehicle. 
 
The peer-to-peer car sharing program must ensure that, during each car sharing period, the 
shared vehicle owner and driver are insured under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy 
that does not exclude the use of the shared motor vehicle by a shared vehicle driver. 
 
The bill exempts MAIF from having to provide coverage to a shared vehicle driver for the 
use of a shared vehicle that is not a replacement vehicle.

Accidents and Incidents in Other States 
 
If a claim that arises out of an occurrence during the car sharing period occurred in another 
state with minimum financial responsibility limits higher than those required in Maryland, 
the insurance policy or policies that apply during the car sharing period must satisfy the 
difference in minimum coverage amounts, up to the applicable policy limits. 
 
Tolls, Fees, Charges, and Fines During Car Sharing 
 
A peer-to-peer car sharing program may transfer monetary liability and charge a shared 
vehicle driver for any toll, fee, charge, or fine imposed for any act or omission involving 
the shared motor vehicle that occurred while the vehicle was under the control or 
possession of the shared vehicle driver during the car sharing period. 
 
Current Law: 
 
Peer-to-peer Car Sharing Programs 
 
A peer-to-peer car sharing program is an online platform that connects vehicle owners with 
drivers to enable the sharing of motor vehicles for financial consideration. Chapter 852  
of 2018 established a (1) regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car sharing in the State; 
(2) a sales and use tax rate of 8% for related sales and charges; and (3) regulatory processes 
for rates and fees charged to a renter through a program. Chapter 9 of the 
2021 special session specifies that, beginning in fiscal 2022, the sales and use tax rate for 
peer-to-peer car sharing is 11.5% if the vehicle is a passenger car, a multipurpose vehicle, 
or a motorcycle that is part of a fleet of vehicles that includes more than 10 vehicles owned 
by the same person. 
 
The regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car sharing established by Chapter 852 included 
motor vehicle insurance requirements and specifications for vehicles used for peer-to-peer 
car sharing. Specifically, the peer-to-peer car sharing program must assume the liability of 
the owner of a shared vehicle during a car sharing period (i.e., when the vehicle is being 
used through the program). Additionally, during a car sharing period, the vehicle being 
shared must be covered by a liability insurance coverage policy maintained by a shared 
vehicle owner, the peer-to-peer car sharing program, or a combination of both. This policy 
must be primary (meaning it pays out first in the event of an accident) during a car sharing 
period to any coverage provided by the driver. However, if the shared vehicle is being used 
as a replacement vehicle (meaning the vehicle is being used to temporarily replace the 
driver’s main vehicle while it is being repaired), then the policy may be secondary to any 
coverage provided by the vehicle driver (meaning that it would pay out after the driver’s 
personal coverage).

Red Light Camera Systems  
 
Unless the driver of a motor vehicle receives a citation from a police officer at the time of 
the violation, the owner or driver of a vehicle recorded by a traffic control signal monitoring 
system entering an intersection against a red signal in violation of the Maryland Vehicle 
Law is subject to a civil penalty of up to $100. Red light camera enforcement applies to a 
violation of specified Maryland Vehicle Law requirements applicable to a vehicle 
approaching a steady circular red signal or arrow, including (1) stopping at a clearly marked 
stop line, or crosswalk if there is no stop line, or intersection if there is no crosswalk and 
(2) remaining stopped until a signal allows the vehicle to proceed.
