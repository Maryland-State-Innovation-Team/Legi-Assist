Center) 
Ways and Means 
 
 
Maryland Longitudinal Data System Center - External Data Sharing With 
Third-Party Data Centers for Multistate Reporting - Authorization 
 
 
This departmental bill authorizes the Governing Board of the Maryland Longitudinal Data 
System (MLDS) Center to allow the MLDS Center to provide individual-level student and 
workforce data to a third-party data center only to enable multistate research and reporting 
on student outcomes. Before authorizing a transfer of data, the board must ensure the 
third‑party data center handles data in accordance with specified standards. Before 
providing data to a third-party data center, MLDS Center must enter into a written data 
sharing agreement that complies with the bill’s security and privacy requirements, and the 
Governing Board must affirmatively approve the sharing of data elements that constitute 
each set, the sharing of each data set, and each proposed research or reporting project that 
seeks to use Maryland data. The bill also repeals language authorizing the board to allow 
MLDS to send student information to the United State Census Bureau. The bill takes effect 
July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  To the extent the board approves data sharing agreements under the bill, 
MLDS and the board can implement such agreements with existing resources, as discussed 
below. Revenues are not affected. 
  
Local Effect:  None.  
 
Small Business Effect:  The Department of Maryland Longitudinal Data System Center 
has determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on small business (attached). The 
Department of Legislative Services concurs with this assessment.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  Under the bill, third-party data center means a secure computational 
research platform managed by a person other than a State agency that allows states to 
securely share data for purposes of data matching and multistate reporting. Data sharing 
agreements with third-party data centers are subject to governing board approval and 
annual review to ensure continued compliance. A third-party data center must:   
 
 
have data handling and security standards that are at least as rigorous as those 
employed by MLDS; 
 
be a FedRAMP-authorized and -certified platform (the Federal Risk and 
Authorization Management Program, managed by the U.S. General Services 
Administration); 
 
use personally identifiable information only to the extent that is necessary for 
matching student data and workforce data with data from other states; 
 
employ certain privacy-enhancing techniques; 
 
use only de-identified data for analytic purposes; 
 
release only aggregate data reports and other output; and  
 
not report data in any form that may be used to identify individuals as specified.  
 
Current Law:  Chapter 190 of 2010 established MLDS to contain individual-level student 
data and workforce data from all levels of education and the State’s workforce. The purpose 
of the data system is to facilitate and enable the exchange of student and workforce data 
among agencies and institutions within the State as well as generate timely and accurate 
information about student achievement that can be used to improve the State’s education 
system and guide decision makers at all levels. The MLDS Center may only use 
de‑identified data in the analysis, research, and reporting conducted by the center. The 
center may only use aggregate data in the release of data in reports and in response to data 
requests. 
 
Student data collected by MLDS includes State and national assessments; course taking 
and completion; grade point average; remediation; retention; degree, diploma, or credential 
attainment; enrollment; demographic data; juvenile delinquency records; elementary and 
secondary school disciplinary records; child welfare data; license, industry certificate, or 
vocational certificate; personally identifiable information; and student disability data by 
specific disability category. Medical and health records are specifically excluded from the 
types of data that MLDS may collect. Workforce data includes employment, wage 
information, and related personally identifiable information, as specified.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
 
At the federal level, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 
governs the privacy of student data. FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure by schools 
that receive federal education funding of personally identifiable information from a 
student’s education record unless the educational institution has obtained signed and dated 
written consent from a parent or eligible student or one of FERPA’s exceptions applies. 
An education record includes a range of information about a student. FERPA permits the 
use of de-identified data and limits the disclosure of personally identifiable information to 
authorized purposes. 
 
Background:  MLDS advises that the center and its counterparts in Washington D.C. and 
Virginia have already applied for and been awarded a grant from the Coleridge Initiative’s 
Democratizing our Data Grant Challenge to establish a multistate data sharing partnership. 
The Coleridge Initiative is a nonprofit organization working with governments to ensure 
that data is more effectively used for public decision-making by providing (1) a platform 
to securely link confidential data within and across states and agencies and (2) data literacy 
training to agency staff. The initiative’s data platform, the Administrative Data Research 
Facility, is a secure, FedRAMP-authorized, cloud-based environment that enables 
government agencies to link their longitudinal data with other states and agencies. 
 
FedRAMP is managed by the U.S. General Services Administration and provides a 
standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring 
for cloud products and services. MLDS advises that the FedRAMP designation requires 
annual audits and reviews and reflects a level of security that is equivalent to federal 
agencies. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  MLDS advises that providing data to a third-party data center in 
accordance with the bill affects operations at the center. However, MLDS also advises that, 
given the administrative work already completed associated with applying for participation 
in the Coleridge Initiative’s Democratizing our Data Grant Challenge (described above), 
the center can manage any additional operational from sharing data in accordance with that 
agreement using existing resources. To the extent the board approves additional sharing 
with additional third-party data centers in the future, MLDS may experience additional 
operational impacts to prepare and share data as necessary. However, this analysis assumes 
that the board will approve future data sharing agreements in accordance with existing 
administrative capacity in MLDS such that existing resources remain sufficient. 
 
Additional Comments:  To participate in the Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes 
(PSEO) project, a college or university must provide student transcript level data to the 
U.S. Census Bureau. Chapters 63 and 64 of 2024 authorize the governing board of the 
MLDS Center to send student information to the U.S. Census Bureau. Since the passage of

HB 293/ Page 4 
Chapters 63 and 64, MLDS advises that the Maryland Higher Education Commission has 
taken the lead on the Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes Explorer project in Maryland. 
Therefore, the center no longer requires approval to share data with the U.S. Census Bureau 
as was authorized by Chapters 63 and 64.

PART A. ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill:

PART B. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
This bill allows the Maryland Longitudinal Data System (MLDS) Center Governing Board to 
authorize the MLDS Center to share student and workforce data with a third party data center for 
the purpose of enabling multistate report projects. If the legislation is approved, the MLDS 
Center has already secured a grant to facilitate the work necessary for multistate data sharing and 
reporting.  Accordingly, there will be no economic impact to the state or on small businesses.
