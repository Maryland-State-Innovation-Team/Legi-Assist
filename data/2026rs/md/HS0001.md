7 legislative investigating committee to investigate allegations of misconduct by State
8 agencies.

9 WHEREAS, An audit of the State Highway Administration, triggered by a tip to the

11 charged nearly $360 million in expenditures to federally funded projects that were deemed
12 unauthorized with the intent to minimize the deficit in the Transportation Trust Fund; and

13 WHEREAS, The investigation triggered by the tip found that, from June 2020
14 through August 2025, there was a 3,523% increase in unauthorized federal fund
15 expenditures, with the most significant increase occurring between July 2022 and August
16 2025; and

17 WHEREAS, The Department of Transportation generally agreed with the findings
18 and recommendations of the investigation; and

19 WHEREAS, A whistleblower report regarding the Maryland Department of Health
20 alleges that two senior officials in the Department had a plan to maintain a high error rate
21 on payments related to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to take
22 advantage of a loophole in federal law that allows states to delay the payment of penalties
23 related to the Program; and
