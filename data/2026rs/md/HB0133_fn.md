Analysis 
 
Current Law/Bill Summary:   
 
Personal Income Tax 
 
Exhibit 1 shows the State’s individual income tax rates and brackets under current law. 
The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act (BRFA) of 2025 increased the top marginal 
income tax rate from 5.75% to 6.50% for Maryland taxable income in excess of $1,000,000 
($1,200,000 for joint filing types). The Act also increased the marginal tax rate applied to 
taxable income from $500,001 up to $1,000,000 (for joint filing types, taxable income from 
$600,001 up to $1,200,000) from 5.75% to 6.25%.

HB 133/ Page 3 
Under the bill, the ordinary State individual income tax rates are repealed, and a flat tax 
rate of 3% is applied to Maryland taxable income for individuals and joint filers with 
federal AGI in excess of $10,000. 
 
 
Net Capital Gain Surtax 
 
The BRFA of 2025 imposes a 2% surtax for taxpayers with federal AGI in excess of 
$350,000 on certain net capital gain included in Maryland AGI. The surtax does not apply 
to gain from the sale or exchange of a primary residential dwelling sold for less than $1.5 
million; assets held in specified retirement savings plans; cattle, horses, or breeding 
livestock held for more than 12 months; certain land subject to a conservation, agricultural, 
or forest preservation easement; § 179 eligible property; or affordable housing owned by a 
nonprofit organization. The Comptroller must distribute 37.5% of the proceeds from the 
surtax to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF). 
 
Under the bill, the net capital gain surtax increases from 2% to 3% and the $350,000 federal 
AGI threshold is repealed; thus, the 3% additional tax applies broadly to taxpayers with 
net capital gain regardless of the amount of their federal AGI. The bill does, however, 
exempt from the surtax the first $10,000 of net capital gain of an individual who is at least 
65 years old. It is unclear whether the $10,000 exemption applies on a per-spouse basis for 
jointly filing spouses who are each at least 65 years old.  
 
Corporate Income Tax 
 
A tax rate of 8.25% is applied to a corporation’s Maryland taxable income. Under the bill, 
the corporate income tax rate is reduced to 3%. 
 
The majority of corporate income tax revenues is distributed to the general fund, while 6% 
is distributed to the Higher Education Investment Fund (HEIF) and an additional specified 
percentage is distributed to the Gasoline and Motor Vehicle Revenue Account (GMVRA) 
within TTF. Chapter 240 of 2022 increased the percentage of corporate income tax 
revenues that is distributed to GMVRA (minus specified distributions for administrative 
costs) from 17.2% to 20% for fiscal 2024, 21% for fiscal 2025, 22% for fiscal 2026 and 
2027, and 20% for fiscal 2028 and beyond. Chapter 240 also increased the percentage of 
GMVRA funds that is distributed to local governments in the form of local highway user 
revenue grants. Chapter 411 of 2024 requires the Comptroller to distribute to the Strategic 
Energy Investment Fund (SEIF) certain income tax revenue from corporations that is 
attributable to qualified data centers that are operational on or after January 1, 2026.

HB 133/ Page 4 
Sales and Use Tax 
 
The general State sales and use tax rate is 6%. Higher sales and use tax rates apply to the 
retail sale of alcoholic beverages and adult-use cannabis (as discussed further below), 
which are taxed at 9% and 12%, respectively. Under the bill, the general State sales and 
use tax rate is reduced to 3%, as are the sales and use tax rates applicable to the sale of 
alcoholic beverages and adult-use cannabis. 
 
The sales and use tax is the State’s second largest source of general fund revenue, 
accounting for approximately $6.1 billion in fiscal 2026 and $6.2 billion in fiscal 2027, 
according to the December 2025 revenue forecast.  
 
 
Adult-Use Cannabis 
 
Chapters 254 and 255 of 2023 imposed a 9% sales and use tax on the retail sale of  
adult-use cannabis. The BRFA of 2025 increased the tax rate to 12% beginning in  
fiscal 2026. The first 25% of cannabis tax revenues are distributed to the general fund. 
After distributions to the Cannabis Regulation and Enforcement Fund and, effective  
October 1, 2026, the Department of Social and Economic Mobility (DoSEM) to defray the 
operating and administrative expenses of the Maryland Cannabis Administration (MCA) 
and Office of Social Equity (OSE), respectively, remaining revenues are distributed to the 
Community Reinvestment and Repair Fund (CRRF) (35% through fiscal 2033 only); the 
Cannabis Public Health Fund (CPHF) (5%); the Cannabis Business Assistance Fund 
(CBAF) (5% through fiscal 2028 only); counties (5% direct allocation); and the  
general fund (50% through fiscal 2028, 55% in fiscal 2029-2033, and 90% in fiscal 2034 
and beyond). Cannabis tax revenues are projected to total $117.8 million in fiscal 2026 and 
$136.5 million in fiscal 2027.  
 
 
Data and IT Services 
 
Beginning in fiscal 2026, the BRFA of 2025 expands the definition of taxable services 
under the State sales and use tax to include data and IT services described under North 
American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) sectors 5132, 518, 519, and 5415. 
(NAICS sector 5132 includes software publishing services and NAICS sectors 518, 519, 
and 5415 include, respectively, (1) computing infrastructure providers, data processing, 
web hosting, and related services; (2) web search portals, libraries, archives, and other 
information services; and (3) computer systems design and related services.) Among other 
changes, the Act imposes a 3.0% sales and use tax on these services and distributes the 
revenue to the general fund. The Act specifies that the sales and use tax on data and  
IT services does not apply to (1) sales of cloud computing services to a qualified 
cybersecurity business or (2) sales to or by a qualified company in an emerging technology

development area, which encompasses quantum computing research and development at 
the University of Maryland, College Park Campus. 
 
 
Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund 
 
Chapter 33 of 2022 altered the distribution of sales and use tax revenues beginning in 
fiscal 2023. Chapter 33 requires the Comptroller, after making certain other distributions, 
to pay to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund (BMFF) the following percentage of 
the remaining sales and use tax revenues:   
 
 
9.2% for fiscal 2023; 
 
11.0% for fiscal 2024; 
 
11.3% for fiscal 2025; 
 
11.7% for fiscal 2026; and 
 
12.1% for fiscal 2027 and each subsequent fiscal year. 
 
Chapter 33 also repealed the distribution of sales and use tax revenues to the BMFF from 
marketplace facilitators, certain out-of-state vendors, and specified digital products or 
digital codes. 
 
State Revenues:  Exhibit 2 displays the bill’s effects on State revenues by provision and 
fund. As shown in the exhibit, the bill results in an estimated $14.1 billion net reduction in 
State revenues, including a $13.3 billion net reduction in general fund revenues. Future 
years reflect current revenue forecasts, annualization, and existing revenue distribution 
provisions. This analysis does not account for any resulting impact on the Maryland 
Department of Transportation’s ability to meet minimum debt service coverage 
requirements.

1 Estimate shown does not account for the effect of the bill’s $10,000 exemption for individuals age 65 or 
older, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time due to data limitations. Thus, actual revenues under 
this provision of the bill may be less.

State Expenditures:  Exhibit 3 displays the bill’s effects on State expenditures by fund. 
As shown in the exhibit, the bill results in an estimated $79.5 million net reduction in State 
expenditures in fiscal 2027. This includes a $14.3 million increase in general fund 
expenditures for MCA and DoSEM. Under the bill’s reduction in the sales and use tax rate 
for adult-use cannabis, cannabis tax revenues are insufficient to fully offset MCA and OSE 
operating and administrative costs in fiscal 2027 and 2028 – thus, it is assumed that  
general funds are needed to backfill lost special fund operating revenues.  
 
This estimate also reflects (1) the estimated decrease in TTF expenditures for local highway 
user revenue grants due to the bill’s reduction in the corporate income tax rate and (2) the 
estimated decrease in CRRF distributions due to the bill’s reduction in the sales and use 
tax rate applied to the retail sale of adult-use cannabis. Future years reflect current revenue 
forecasts, annualization, projected MCA and OSE operating expenses, and applicable 
revenue distribution provisions.

The Comptroller’s Office has advised the Department of Legislative Services (DLS) that 
additional personnel resources – including a minimum of five contractual attorneys for a 
period of at least 18 months and two full-time regular revenue examiners – are needed in 
order to implement the bill’s changes and respond to requests for guidance from taxpayers 
and practitioners. Related estimated costs exceed $780,000 in fiscal 2027, assuming a  
90-day start-up delay from the bill’s July 1, 2026 effective date. DLS is unable to 
independently verify the Comptroller’s personnel needs at this time and advises that the 
Comptroller’s Office can request additional resources through the annual budget process 
as needed. Any related general fund expenditures are not reflected in this analysis.  
 
Local Revenues:  Exhibit 4 displays the bill’s estimated effects on local revenues. As 
shown in the exhibit, local revenues decrease by an estimated $96.9 million in fiscal 2027 
due to reduced local highway user revenues, counties’ share of reduced cannabis sales and 
use tax revenues, and a reduction in distributions from CRRF. Future years reflect 
annualization, current revenue forecasts, and existing revenue distribution provisions.
