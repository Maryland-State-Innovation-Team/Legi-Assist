(Delegate Taylor) 
Judiciary 
 
 
Criminal Procedure - Expungement - No Finding and Case Terminated Without 
Finding 
 
 
This bill expands eligibility for an expungement under § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure 
Article to include a charge that was not disposed of by unequivocal conviction but was 
instead (1) disposed of by the court with a no finding designation or (2) included in a case 
that was designated by the court as having been terminated without finding.

State Effect:  General fund expenditures increase by $11,700 in FY 2027 only for the 
Judiciary to revise expungement-related brochures, forms, and instructional videos. While 
the bill is not anticipated to otherwise materially affect State finances, there may be an 
operational impact on the Judiciary, as discussed below. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill is not anticipated to materially affect local finances or operations. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None.

Current Law: 
 
Expungements 
 
Other than specified court-initiated expungements under § 10-105.1 of the Criminal 
Procedure Article, to begin the process of expungement, a petitioner must file a petition for 
expungement with the court under § 10-105 or § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article,

HB 187/ Page 2 
which establishes eligibility for the expungement of records pertaining to a criminal charge 
or conviction. With some exceptions, § 10-105 applies to dispositions other than a 
conviction, and § 10-110 applies to expungements of convictions. 
 
Expungement of a court or police record means removal from public inspection: 
 
 
by obliteration; 
 
by removal to a separate secure area to which persons who do not have a legitimate 
reason for access are denied access; or 
 
if access to a court record or police record can be obtained only by reference to 
another such record, by the expungement of that record, or the part of it that provides 
access. 
 
Units of Charges 
 
Pursuant to § 10-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article, if two or more charges, other than 
one for a minor traffic violation or possession of cannabis under § 5-601 of the Criminal 
Law Article, arise from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts, they are considered 
to be a unit. A charge for a minor traffic violation or possession of cannabis under  
§ 5-601 of the Criminal Law Article that arises from the same incident, transaction, or set 
of facts as a charge in the unit is not a part of the unit. If a person is not entitled to 
expungement of one charge or conviction in a unit, the person is not entitled to 
expungement of any other charge or conviction in the unit. This “unit rule” applies to 
expungements under §§ 10-105 and 10-110. 
 
Section 10-105 of the Criminal Procedure Article  
 
Under § 10-105 of the Criminal Procedure Article, a person who has been charged with the 
commission of a crime for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed or who has been 
charged with a civil offense or infraction, except a juvenile offense, may file a petition for 
expungement of a police record, court record, or other record maintained by the State or a 
political subdivision of the State, under various circumstances listed in the statute. With 
specified exceptions, these grounds include acquittal, dismissal of charges, entry of 
probation before judgment, entry of nolle prosequi, stet of charge, and gubernatorial 
pardon. Individuals convicted of a crime that is no longer a crime, convicted of possession 
of cannabis under § 5-601 of the Criminal Law Article, convicted of or found not criminally 
responsible for specified public nuisance crimes or specified misdemeanors, or who had a 
conviction vacated due to being a victim of human trafficking (as defined in statute), are 
also eligible for expungement of the associated criminal records under certain 
circumstances.

HB 187/ Page 3 
In general, a petition for expungement under § 10-105 based on an acquittal, a 
nolle prosequi, or a dismissal may not be filed within three years after the disposition, 
unless the petitioner files a written waiver and release of all tort claims arising from the 
charge. A petition based on a probation before judgment may not be filed before the 
petitioner’s discharge from probation or three years after the probation was granted, 
whichever is later. A petition based on a stet with the requirement of drug or alcohol abuse 
treatment may not be filed before the petitioner’s completion of treatment or three years 
after the stet was entered on the docket, whichever is later. Otherwise, a petition based on 
a stet or a compromise may not be filed within three years after the stet or compromise.  
 
Unless the State’s Attorney files an objection to the petition for expungement within 
30 days after the petition is served, the court must pass an order requiring the expungement 
of all police records and court records about the charge. If the State’s Attorney files a timely 
objection to the petition, the court must hold a hearing. If the court at the hearing finds that 
the person is entitled to expungement, the court must order the expungement of all police 
records and court records about the charge. 
 
In determining whether the person is entitled to expungement, the court must consider, to 
the extent applicable (1) the person’s success at probation, parole, or mandatory 
supervision and (2) whether the person has paid any monetary restitution ordered by the 
court in the original proceeding or does not have the ability to pay the restitution. 
 
If the court finds that the person is not entitled to expungement, the court must deny the 
petition. A person is not entitled to expungement if (1) subject to a specified exception, the 
petition is based on the entry of probation before judgment and the person, within 
three years of the entry of the probation before judgment, has been convicted of a crime 
other than a minor traffic violation or a crime where the act on which the conviction is 
based is no longer a crime or (2) the person is a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding. 
 
Except for court initiated expungements under § 10-105.1 and unless an order is stayed 
pending an appeal, within 60 days after entry of the order, every custodian of the police 
records and court records that are subject to the order of expungement must advise in 
writing the court and the person who is seeking expungement of compliance with the order. 
 
Section 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article 
 
Section 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article authorizes an individual convicted of any 
of a list of approximately 100 specified offenses or an attempt, a conspiracy, or a 
solicitation of any of these offenses, to file a petition for expungement of the conviction, 
subject to specified procedures and requirements. An itemized list of convictions eligible 
for expungement under § 10-110 is shown in the Appendix – Convictions Eligible for 
Expungement.

HB 187/ Page 4 
Petitions for expungements under § 10-110 are subject to the waiting periods listed below. 
These waiting periods begin after the sentence has expired, including parole, probation, or 
mandatory supervision: 
 
 
Misdemeanor (general):  5 years; 
 
Felony (general), Second-degree Assault, or Common Law Battery:  7 years; 
 
Domestically Related Crime (§ 6-233 of the Criminal Procedure Article):  15 years; 
 
Possession with Intent to Distribute Cannabis:  3 years; and 
 
Burglary in the First Degree (Breaking and Entering – Theft), Burglary in the 
Second Degree, or Felony General Theft:  10 years. 
 
If the person is convicted of a new crime during the applicable waiting period, the original 
conviction or convictions are not eligible for expungement unless the new conviction 
becomes eligible for expungement. 
 
A person is not eligible for expungement if the person is a defendant in a pending criminal 
proceeding. 
 
Unless the State’s Attorney or a victim files an objection to the petition for expungement 
within 30 days after the petition is served, the court must pass an order requiring the 
expungement of all police records and court records about the charge. 
 
If the State’s Attorney or a victim files a timely objection to the petition, the court must 
hold a hearing. The court must order the expungement of all police records and 
court records about the charge after a hearing, if the court finds and states on the record: 
 
 
that the conviction is eligible for expungement under specified provisions of 
§ 10‑110; 
 
that giving due regard to the nature of the crime, the history and character of the 
person, and the person’s success at probation, parole, or mandatory supervision, the 
person is not a risk to public safety;  
 
that the person has paid any monetary restitution ordered by the court in the original 
proceeding or does not have the ability to pay the restitution; and 
 
that an expungement would be in the interest of justice. 
 
If at a hearing the court finds that a person is not entitled to expungement, the court must 
deny the petition. 
 
Unless an order is stayed pending appeal, within 60 days after entry of the order, every 
custodian of the police records and court records that are subject to the order of 
expungement must advise in writing the court and the person who is seeking expungement 
of compliance with the order.

Automatic Expungements – § 10-105.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article 
 
Pursuant to Chapter 680 of 2021, beginning October 1, 2021, any police record, 
court record, or other record maintained by the State or a political subdivision of the State 
relating to the charging of a civil offense under § 5-601(c)(2)(ii) (related to possession of 
cannabis) of the Criminal Law Article or a crime other than a violation of the 
Transportation Article for which the defendant is not required to appear, must be expunged 
three years after a disposition of the charge if no charge in the case resulted in a disposition 
other than acquittal; dismissal; not guilty; or nolle prosequi, other than nolle prosequi with 
a requirement of drug or alcohol treatment. 
 
State Fiscal Effect: 
 
Judiciary 
 
General fund expenditures increase by $11,740 in fiscal 2027 only for the Judiciary to 
revise expungement-related brochures, forms, and instructional videos. However, the bill 
may also have an operational effect. The Judiciary advises that the process of determining 
eligibility for expungement based on a conviction is primarily dependent upon how a 
disposition of a charge is listed within the Judiciary’s case management system. The 
Judiciary notes that it does not mark cases with dispositions of “no finding” or “terminated 
without finding” and advises that it is unclear what types of dispositions these terms are 
intended to represent. 
 
The Judiciary further advises that because it is not familiar with the terminology referenced 
in the bill and because its case management system does not use this terminology, it cannot 
estimate the impact of the bill on expungement filings and court workloads. The 
Department of Legislative Services advises that though the bill does not define any of these 
dispositions, assuming the bill applies to a small and unique group of dispositions and the 
terminology used in the bill is not interpreted to expand expungement eligibility beyond 
this limited group, the bill can likely be implemented with existing budgeted resources. 
 
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services 
 
Assuming that the bill applies only to a small and unique group of dispositions, the 
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) can handle any additional 
expungement orders using existing budgeted resources. For context, DPSCS advises that 
for every 2,500 additional expungement orders, the Criminal Justice Information System 
requires two additional employees.
