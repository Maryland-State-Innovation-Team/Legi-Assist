House Bill 269 
(Chair, Government, Labor, and Elections 
Committee)(By Request - Departmental - State Ethics 
Commission) 
Government, Labor, and Elections 
 
 
Maryland Public Ethics Law - Financial Disclosure Statements - State Officials of 
and Candidates to Be a State Official of the Judicial Branch 
 
 
This departmental bill requires the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) or another 
body designated by the Supreme Court of Maryland to (1) administer and implement the 
financial disclosure provisions of the Public Ethics Law for State officials of the 
Judicial Branch and candidates to be State officials of the Judicial Branch and (2) maintain 
financial disclosure statements of State officials and candidates to be State officials of the 
Judicial Branch and make those statements available for public inspection. As such, the 
Commission on Judicial Disabilities, the Judicial Ethics Committee, or another body 
designated by the Supreme Court of Maryland no longer are required to administer and 
implement those provisions, but they retain responsibility for administering the conflict of 
interest provisions of the Maryland Public Ethics Law for State officials of the 
Judicial Branch and candidates to be State officials of the Judicial Branch. Finally, the bill 
repeals the requirement that the Supreme Court of Maryland send financial disclosure 
statements submitted by judges, candidates for judgeships, or judicial appointees to the 
State Ethics Commission (SEC). The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary

Analysis 
 
Current Law:   
 
Maryland Public Ethics Law 
 
The Maryland Public Ethics Law sets out requirements, prohibitions, and procedures that 
affect State officials in the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of government for 
the purpose of maintaining people’s trust in government and protecting against the 
improper influence and appearance of improper influence of government. 
 
The Public Ethics Law is generally administered and implemented by SEC, with 
two statutory exceptions. First, the Joint Ethics Committee of the Maryland 
General Assembly must administer and implement provisions related to conflicts of 
interest as they apply to members of the General Assembly. Second, the Commission on 
Judicial Disabilities, Judicial Ethics Committee, or another body designated by the 
Supreme Court of Maryland, must administer and implement provisions related to conflicts 
of interest and financial disclosure as they apply to State officials of the Judicial Branch.  
 
Conflict of Interest 
 
The Maryland Public Ethics Law regulating conflicts of interest generally prohibits a State 
official or employee from (1) participating in a matter if the official, a qualifying relative, 
or other specified entities have an interest in the matter; (2) being employed or having a 
financial interest in an entity subject to the authority of that official or employee or of the 
governmental unit with which the official or employee is affiliated; (3) being employed or 
having financial interest in an entity that is negotiating or has entered a contract with that 
governmental unit or an entity that is a subcontractor on a contact with that governmental 
unit; (4) holding any other employment relationship that would impair the impartiality and 
independent judgment of the official or employee; (5) soliciting or accepting any gift 
exceeding $20 in value, among others; (6) intentionally using the prestige of office for 
private gain or influence, as specified; (7) disclosing or using confidential information 
acquired by reason of the individual’s public position and not available to the public for 
personal gain or economic benefit of another; (8) unlawfully harassing or discriminating 
against certain individuals; or (9) retaliating against an individual for reporting or 
participating in the investigation of a potential violation of the Maryland Public Ethics 
Law. SEC may make certain exemptions specified by statute.

Annual Financial Disclosure Statement 
 
Public officials, State officials, and candidates for office as a State official must file, under 
oath, financial disclosure statements with SEC. Statements generally must disclose 
(1) interests in real property; (2) interests in corporations and partnerships; (3) interests in 
and employment by business entities doing business with the State; (4) debts owed to 
entities doing business with or regulated by an individual’s governmental unit; (5) family 
members employed by the State; (6) sources of earned income; and (7) gifts, as specified. 
A filer must disclose an interest held by (1) a spouse or child of an individual, if the interest 
was controlled, directly or indirectly, by the individual at any time during the applicable 
period; (2) a business entity in which the individual held a 10% or greater interest at any 
time during the applicable period; or (3) a trust or estate in which, at any time during the 
applicable period, the individual held a reversionary interest, was a beneficiary, or was a 
settlor, if a revocable trust.  
 
SEC and the Joint Ethics Committee must maintain the statements made under the financial 
disclosure requirements and make them available to the public during normal office hours.  
 
Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act (2024), Generally 
 
Chapters 414 and 415 of 2024 (Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act) created, 
among other things, the Office of Information Privacy (OIP) in AOC. A “protected 
individual,” or OIP (on behalf of a protected individual), is authorized to make a request 
for a person or governmental entity to not publish “personal information” of the protected 
individual (or to remove such information from an existing publication), as specified. In 
addition, OIP must establish and administer a Judicial Address Confidentiality Program for 
the general purpose of safeguarding the actual address of a program participant in relation 
to public records or inspection, including the shielding of real property records, as 
specified. 
 
“Personal information” means a home address, home telephone number, mobile telephone 
number, personal email address, Social Security number, driver’s license number, federal 
tax identification number, bank account number, credit or debit card number, license plate 
number or unique identifier of a vehicle, birth or marital record, child’s name, school or 
daycare, place of worship, or, for specified protected individuals, a place of employment. 
“Personal information” does not include information that (1) has been publicly disclosed 
with the consent of the protected individual or (2) is relevant to and displayed as part of a 
news story, commentary, editorial, or other speech on matters of public concern.

“Protected Individual” means a:  
 
 
current or retired justice or judge of a court established under Article IV of the 
Maryland Constitution; 
 
current or retired justice or judge of a federal court, including a U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, domiciled in the State; 
 
current or retired magistrate appointed by a circuit court of the State; 
 
current or retired United States magistrate judge domiciled in the State; 
 
current or retired Commissioner of the District Court of Maryland; or 
 
spouse, child, or dependent who resides in the same household as an individual 
described above.  
 
State Officials of the Judicial Branch 
 
The Judiciary advises that State officials of the Judicial Branch include Supreme Court 
justices; judges in appellate, circuit, and District Courts; former judges; Orphans’ Court 
judges; magistrates; commissioners; auditors; and candidates for judicial offices.  
 
Background:  SEC advises that the bill is necessary to:  (1) clarify responsibilities for 
administering the Public Ethics Law; (2) streamline the public records inspection and 
notification process for State Officials and candidates to be State officials of the 
Judicial Branch; and (3) eliminate an administrative burden on the SEC and Judiciary. 
 
Specifically, SEC advises that the requirement that the Judiciary transmit to SEC copies of 
financial disclosure statements filed by State officials of the Judicial Branch creates an 
undue administrative burden for the Judiciary. SEC also suggests that current law lacks 
clarity regarding the Supreme Court of Maryland’s authority over conflict of interest and 
financial disclosure provisions of the Public Ethics Law as it pertains to State officials, or 
candidates to be State officials, of the Judicial Branch.  
 
Repealing the requirement that the Judiciary transmit financial disclosure statements to 
SEC necessitates the bill’s addition of a statutory requirement that the Judiciary retain the 
statements and make them available to the public upon request.  
 
State Expenditures:  Judiciary advises that AOC is not currently equipped to handle 
unplanned public visitors who may wish to examine financial statements during normal 
office hours. Furthermore, AOC advises that, to comply with the regulations established 
by the Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act of 2024, financial statements of 
judges and judicial appointees must be reviewed by staff prior to being viewed by the 
public and thus may not be viewable on an on-demand basis. DLS believes that AOC can 
implement the requirements of the bill with existing budgeted resources.
