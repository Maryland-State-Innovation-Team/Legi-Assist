(Delegate Allen) 
Judiciary 
 
 
Criminal Law - Fraud - Assisted Reproductive Treatment 
 
 
This bill prohibits a person from intentionally or knowingly providing “assisted 
reproductive treatment” to another person using the person’s own sperm or ovum, unless 
the recipient consented to treatment using that sperm or ovum. A violator is guilty of a 
felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a maximum 
fine of $5,000. If a woman gives birth to a child after receiving assisted reproductive 
treatment from a violator, the woman, the woman’s spouse or domestic partner, or the child 
may bring a civil action against the violator to recover specified damages. Additionally, 
the child is entitled to a qualified protective order granting access to the violator’s medical 
records and health history. Nothing in the bill may be construed to limit the availability of 
any other remedy provided by law.

HB 645/ Page 2 
A civil action brought under the bill must be filed within 10 years after the child who was 
born as a result of the assisted reproductive treatment reaches age 18, within 20 years after 
the day the treatment was provided, or within 2 years after the day on which an individual 
first discovers sufficient evidence through DNA analysis that the individual has a cause of 
action. A plaintiff who prevails is entitled to the costs of the treatment, liquidated damages 
up to $50,000, compensatory damages, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
Current Law:  Under Maryland law, there are more than 50 mandated health insurance 
benefits that certain carriers must provide to their enrollees, including coverage for IVF. 
The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires nongrandfathered health 
plans to cover 10 essential health benefits (EHBs), which include items and services in the 
following categories:  (1) ambulatory patient services; (2) emergency services; 
(3) hospitalization; (4) maternity and newborn care; (5) mental health and substance use 
disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; (6) prescription drugs; 
(7) rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; (8) laboratory services; 
(9) preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and (10) pediatric 
services.  
 
Under § 31-116 of the Insurance Article, EHBs must be included in the State benchmark 
plan and, notwithstanding any other benefits mandated by State law, must be the benefits 
required in (1) all individual health benefit plans and health benefit plans offered to small 
employers (except for grandfathered health plans) offered outside the Maryland Health 
Benefit Exchange (MHBE) and (2) all qualified health plans offered in MHBE.  
 
Carriers that provide pregnancy-related benefits are required to cover outpatient expenses 
arising from IVF performed on a policyholder or subscriber or the dependent spouse of the 
policyholder or subscriber. IVF benefits may be limited to three IVF attempts per live birth, 
not to exceed a maximum lifetime benefit of $100,000. Carriers are not responsible for any 
costs incurred by a policyholder or subscriber to obtain donor sperm.  
 
To qualify for IVF benefits, a married patient and the patient’s spouse must have a history 
of involuntary infertility of at least one year’s duration or infertility associated with 
endometriosis, diethylstilbestrol exposure, blockage or removal of one or both fallopian 
tubes, or abnormal male factors. An unmarried patient must have (1) had three attempts of 
artificial insemination over the course of one year failing to result in pregnancy or 
(2) infertility associated with endometriosis, diethylstilbestrol exposure, blockage or 
removal of one or both fallopian tubes, or abnormal male factors. The patient must have 
been unable to attain a successful pregnancy through a less costly infertility treatment 
available under the policy or contract, and IVF must be performed at specified medical 
facilities. In addition, for a married patient whose spouse is of the opposite sex, the patient’s 
eggs must be fertilized with the spouse’s sperm unless (1) the spouse is unable to produce

and deliver functional sperm and (2) the inability does not result from a vasectomy or other 
method of voluntary sterilization.
