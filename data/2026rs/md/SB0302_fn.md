Judicial Proceedings 
 
 
Criminal Law - Causing Ingestion of an Abortion-Inducing Drug - Prohibition 
(Women's Freedom From Coercion Act) 
 
 
This bill prohibits a person from knowingly and willfully causing another person to ingest 
an “abortion-inducing drug” if they (1) know or believe that the other person is pregnant 
and (2) do so without the other person’s consent, through fraud or coercion, or by force or 
threat of force. A violator is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment 
for up to 25 years.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Potential minimal increase in general fund expenditures for the Department 
of Public Safety and Correctional Services due to the bill’s incarceration penalty. 
Otherwise, the bill is not expected to materially affect State finances or operations, 
including finances or operations of the Judiciary or the Office of the Public Defender 
(OPD).  
 
Local Effect:  The bill is not anticipated to materially affect local finances or operations. 
 
Small Business Effect:  None. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  “Abortion-inducing drug” means a drug, medicine, or a medicinal or 
chemical preparation for internal human consumption that is designed to induce an 
abortion. 
 
Current Law:  For a detailed discussion of both federal and State abortion laws, please 
see Appendix – Legal Developments Regarding Abortion.

SB 302/ Page 2 
State Fiscal Effect:  OPD advises that the bill’s creation of a new felony may result in 
costs for the agency due to additional cases and litigation requiring the equivalent of 
one attorney statewide. The Department of Legislative Services advises that while the bill 
may increase OPD workloads, OPD can likely accommodate any increased level of effort 
with existing budgeted resources.

Appendix – Legal Developments Regarding Abortion 
 
 
Status of Federal Abortion Law 
 
In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned precedent regarding abortion access in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Before this decision, abortions prior to 
viability were constitutionally protected based on Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of 
Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The petitioners in Dobbs sought to overturn the 
invalidation of Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, which prohibited abortions after 
15 weeks gestation except for medical emergencies or severe fetal abnormalities. The 
U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Mississippi law by overturning Roe and Casey, holding 
that there is no constitutionally protected right to an abortion as it is not a right explicitly 
granted by the Constitution or a right “deeply rooted” in the country’s history and tradition. 
The Dobbs decision leaves states to decide how to regulate abortion access, resulting in a 
patchwork of state laws with varying degrees of access to abortion care. 
 
Maryland Abortion Law 
 
Roe and Casey were codified in Maryland law before the Dobbs decision, thereby limiting 
its impact in the State. Section 20-209 of the Health-General Article prohibits the State 
from interfering with an abortion conducted (1) before viability or (2) at any point, if the 
procedure is necessary to protect the health or life of the woman or in cases of fetal defect, 
deformity, or abnormality. The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) may also adopt 
regulations consistent with established clinical practice if they are necessary and the least 
intrusive method to protect the life and health of the woman. 
 
Chapter 56 of 2022 expanded beyond physicians the types of health care providers who 
may provide abortions to include nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, licensed certified 
midwives, physician assistants, and other qualified licensed health care providers. The Act 
also established the Abortion Care Clinical Training Program to (1) ensure there are enough 
health care professionals to provide abortion services in the State and (2) require health 
insurers and Maryland Medicaid to cover abortion services without a deductible, 
coinsurance, copayment, or other cost-sharing requirement. Chapters 248 and 249 of 2023 
require certain health insurers that provide labor and delivery coverage to also cover 
abortion care services, with limited exceptions. 
 
Chapters 244 and 245 of 2023 proposed a constitutional amendment to (1) establish an 
individual’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the 
ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one’s own pregnancy 
and (2) prohibit the State from directly or indirectly denying, burdening, or abridging the

right unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means. 
In November 2024, Maryland voters approved this constitutional amendment through a 
ballot referendum. 
 
Chapters 435 and 436 of 2025 established the Public Health Abortion Grant Program. The 
program was intended to transfer excess funds from carriers’ segregated accounts, which 
are required under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), to a 
separate fund under MDH to provide grants to improve access to abortion care clinical 
services for individuals without sufficient resources. Uncodified language in the Acts 
specified that the bills must terminate if the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) advised that the bills violate the ACA. On December 9. 2025, CMS issued 
new guidance about the use of carriers’ segregated funds. CMS subsequently notified the 
Maryland Insurance Administration that, in accordance with the guidance, the Acts exceed 
the permissible uses of the segregated funds under Section 1303 of the ACA. Therefore, 
the Acts must terminate. 
 
Maryland Shield Laws 
 
Chapters 248 and 249 generally prohibit the disclosure of mifepristone data or the 
diagnosis, procedure, medication, or related codes for abortion care and other sensitive 
health services (including reproductive health services other than abortion care) by a health 
information exchange, electronic health network, or health care provider. The Acts also 
define “legally protected health care” to mean all reproductive health services, medications, 
and supplies related to the provision of abortion care and other sensitive health services as 
determined by the Secretary of Health based on the recommendation of the Protected 
Health Care Commission. 
 
Chapters 246 and 247 of 2023 generally (1) establish additional protections for information 
related to “legally protected health care” when that information is sought by another state; 
(2) prohibit a health occupations board from taking specified disciplinary actions related 
to the provision of legally protected health care; (3) prohibit a medical professional liability 
insurer from taking “adverse actions” against a practitioner related to the practice of legally 
protected health care; and (4) prohibit specified State entities, agents, and employees from 
participating in any interstate investigation seeking to impose specified liabilities or 
sanctions against a person for activity related to legally protected health care (with limited 
exception). Data related to legally protected health care is also generally protected from 
other states. 
 
State Actions Following the Dobbs Decision 
 
As of December 2025, 41 states have some type of abortion ban or gestational limit in place 
with limited exceptions. Thirteen states (Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky,

SB 302/ Page 5 
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and 
West Virginia) have implemented total abortion bans. Twenty-eight states have abortion 
restrictions based on gestational duration, including seven states that ban abortion at or 
before 18 weeks gestation and 21 states that ban abortion at some point after 18 weeks. All 
41 states have an exception for a threat to the mother’s life; 22 states have exceptions for a 
threat to the physical health of the mother; and 13 states have exceptions for a threat to the 
general health of the mother. Several states also have limited exceptions for rape (9 states), 
incest (8 states), or lethal fetal anomalies (13 states).
