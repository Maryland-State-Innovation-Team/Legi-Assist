31 to procure electricity for these customers directly from an electricity supplier through one
32 or more bilateral contracts outside the competitive process.

33 2. A. As the Commission directs, the competitive process
34 shall include a series of competitive wholesale bids in which the investor–owned electric
35 company solicits bids to supply anticipated standard offer service load for residential and

38 needed to meet demand in a cost–effective manner.

1 B. The competitive process may include different bidding
2 structures and mechanisms for base load, peak load, and very short–term procurement.

3 C. By regulation or order, as a part of the competitive process,
4 the Commission shall require or allow the procurement of cost–effective energy efficiency
5 and conservation measures and services with projected and verifiable energy savings to
6 offset anticipated demand to be served by standard offer service, and the imposition of other
7 cost–effective demand–side management programs.

8 3. A. In order to prevent an excessive amount of load
9 being exposed to upward price risks and volatility, the Commission may stagger the dates
10 for the competitive wholesale auctions.

11 B. By regulation or order, the Commission may allow a date
12 on which a competitive wholesale auction takes place to be altered based on current market
13 conditions.

14 4. By regulation or order, the Commission may allow an
15 investor–owned electric company to refuse to accept some or all of the bids made in a
16 competitive wholesale auction in accordance with standards adopted by the Commission.

17 5. The investor–owned electric company shall publicly
18 disclose the names of all bidders and the names and load allocation of all successful bidders
19 90 days after all contracts for supply are executed.

20 (5) An electric company may procure the electricity needed to meet its
21 standard offer service electricity supply obligation from any electricity supplier, including
22 an affiliate of the electric company.

23 (6) In order to meet long–term, anticipated demand in the State for
24 standard offer service and other electricity supply, the Commission may require or allow
25 an investor–owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own
26 generating facilities, and transmission facilities necessary to interconnect the generating
27 facilities with the electric grid, subject to appropriate cost recovery.

28 (7) (i) To determine whether an appropriate phased implementation of
29 electricity rates that is necessary to protect residential customers from the impact of
30 sudden and significant increases in electricity rates, the Commission in the case of an
31 increase of 20% or more over the previous year’s total electricity rates, shall conduct
32 evidentiary proceedings, including public hearings.

33 (ii) 1. A deferral of costs as part of a phased implementation of
34 electricity rates by an investor–owned electric company shall be treated as a regulatory
35 asset to be recovered in accordance with a rate stabilization plan under Part III of this
36 subtitle or any other plan for phased implementation approved by the Commission.

14 standard offer service load through a portfolio of blended wholesale supply contracts of
15 short, medium, and long terms, and other appropriate electricity products and strategies,
16 as needed to meet demand in a cost–effective manner, may choose to continue to use a
17 blended portfolio:

18 1. as approved and modified by the electric cooperative’s
19 board of directors; and

20 2. with appropriate review for prudent cost recovery as
21 determined by the Commission.

22 (ii) The Commission may not set or enforce a termination date for
23 the procurement of supply through a managed portfolio previously approved by the
24 Commission.

25 (9) (i) The Commission, on request by an electric cooperative or on its
26 own initiative, shall initiate a proceeding to investigate options for a rate stabilization plan
27 to assist residential electric customers to gradually adjust to market rates over an extended
28 period of time.

29 (ii) If an electric cooperative determines that total electric rates for
30 residential customers are anticipated to increase by more than 20% in a 12–month period
31 resulting from an increase in the cost of generation, the electric cooperative shall survey its
32 membership to determine whether to make a request to the Commission to initiate a
33 proceeding under subsection (a) of this section.
