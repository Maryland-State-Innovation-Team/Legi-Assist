HOUSE BILL 980 3

1 WHEREAS, To engender this high level of confidence in the child welfare system, it
2 is important that children and families who become involved in the system, mandatory
3 reporters, and the general public have a well–publicized, easily accessible, and transparent
4 complaint process for voicing concerns regarding the child welfare system along with the
5 expectation that those concerns, once voiced, will be heard and addressed in a timely and
6 appropriate manner; and

7 WHEREAS, To improve child welfare outcomes and to foster best practices, there
8 must be effective accountability mechanisms, including the review and evaluation of
9 concerns voiced by children and families, mandatory reporters, persons involved in the
10 child welfare system, and members of the general public, that provide policymakers with
11 the information necessary to formulate systemic changes, where appropriate; now,
12 therefore,
