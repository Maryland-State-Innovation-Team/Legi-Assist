      "bill_summary": "The Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2025 (BRFA) implements a comprehensive set of fiscal measures to balance Maryland's state budget for fiscal 2025 and 2026. The bill increases state revenues by establishing higher individual income tax rates and brackets for high earners, increasing the vehicle excise tax from 6% to 6.5%, and expanding the sales and use tax to include data and information technology services. It provides expenditure relief by reducing or repealing various mandated appropriations, shifts significant costs for teacher pensions and property valuation to local governments, and authorizes the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars from special fund balances and the Local Income Tax Reserve Account to the General Fund.",

      "fiscal_impact_summary": "According to the Fiscal and Policy Note, the bill is estimated to provide a total General Fund improvement of approximately $3.38 billion across fiscal 2025 and 2026. This is comprised of approximately $2.33 billion in revenue increases and $1.05 billion in general fund expenditure reductions. Key revenue drivers include established top marginal income tax rates of up to 6.5% and a 2% surtax on certain net capital gains for high earners, as well as a 0.5% increase in the vehicle excise tax. Local jurisdictions will experience a net negative fiscal impact of approximately $157.5 million in fiscal 2026 due to cost-shifting for teacher pensions, property valuation reimbursements, and reduced supplemental grants, partially offset by an estimated $21 million increase in local income tax revenues resulting from changes to state standard deduction and itemized deduction policies.",
