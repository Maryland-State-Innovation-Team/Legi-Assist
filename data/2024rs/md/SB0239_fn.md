established in 1979, licenses occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants,

complaints from the public regarding occupational therapists and occupational therapy 
assistants. The seven-member board includes four licensed occupational therapists, 
one licensed occupational therapy assistant, and two members of the public.

SB 239/ Page 2 
The board is one of approximately 60 regulatory entities and activities subject to 
termination unless reauthorized periodically through statute. Under MPEA, these entities 
may also be subject to an evaluation by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability (OPEGA) within DLS prior to their termination. However, OPEGA may 
conduct an evaluation only if directed by specified entities or by legislation. The board is 
scheduled to terminate July 1, 2025; OPEGA was not asked to conduct an evaluation prior 
to its termination. Accordingly, the board has requested reauthorizing legislation.
