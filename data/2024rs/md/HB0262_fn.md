Consumer Reports and Consumer Reporting Agencies 
 
A “consumer report” is any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a 
consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer’s credit worthiness, credit standing, 
credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living 
which is used or expected to be used or collected (in whole or in part) for the purpose of 
serving as a factor in establishing a consumer’s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be

used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; (2) employment purposes; or 
(3) other specified purposes, as authorized by State law. 
 
A “consumer reporting agency” is any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a 
cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages (in whole or in part) in the practice of 
assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers 
for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means 
or facility of commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing the reports. 
 
Prohibited Information in Consumer Reports 
 
Consumer reporting agencies may not report in a consumer credit report (1) bankruptcies 
of more than 10 years before the credit report; (2) suits and judgments of more than 
seven years before the report, or the expiration of the governing statute of limitations, 
whichever is longer; (3) paid tax liens whose payment date is more than seven years before 
the report; (4) accounts placed for collection or charged to profit and loss more than 
seven years before the report; (5) records of arrest, indictment, or conviction of crime 
whose date of disposition, release, or parole is more than seven years before the report date; 
or (6) any other adverse information that predates the report by more than seven years. 
 
Under current law, the prohibition against including the above information does not apply 
in the case of a consumer credit report to be used in connection with (1) a credit transaction 
whose principal amount may involve at least $50,000; (2) the underwriting of life insurance 
with a face value of at least $50,000; or (3) the employment of an individual in a position 
with an annual salary of at least $20,000. 
 
Under the bill, these thresholds are increased to $150,000 for credit transactions and life 
insurance underwriting and $75,000 for employment determinations. 
 
Small Business Effect:  The bill may permit some small businesses to secure credit (or 
more favorable loan terms) once certain adverse information is no longer allowed to be 
reported under the higher threshold exemptions. 
 
 
Additional Information 
 
Recent Prior Introductions:  Similar legislation has not been introduced within the last 
three years.
