  HB 932 
Department of Legislative Services 
Maryland General Assembly 
2024 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 932 
(Delegate Cullison, et al.) 
Health and Government Operations 
Finance 
 
Health Insurance - Utilization Review - Revisions 
 
 
This bill, among other things, (1) requires carriers, by July 1, 2026, to establish and 
maintain an online process for prior authorizations that meets specified parameters; 
(2) alters current requirements for the prior authorization of specified prescription drugs; 
(3) requires carriers to comply with certain requirements when rendering adverse decisions; 
(4) alters timelines for certain adverse decisions; (5) alters and adds to the criteria and 
standards that must be used by private review agents; and (6) requires existing benchmarks 
for standardizing and automating preauthorization of health care services and payors’ 
online preauthorization systems to include certain utilization criteria. The bill includes 
study and reporting requirements involving the Maryland Health Care Commission 
(MHCC) and the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA). The bill also repeals obsolete 
provisions and makes conforming changes. The bill generally takes effect 
January 1, 2025; the bill’s study and reporting requirements take effect July 1, 2024.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Minimal increase in MIA special fund revenues in FY 2025 from the 
$125 rate and form filing fee. Any additional workload on MHCC and MIA can likely be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Expenditures for the State Employee and 
Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program increase by $1.75 million in FY 2025 and 
$3.5 million annually thereafter, as discussed below.  
  
Local Effect:  To the extent health insurance costs increase under the bill, health care 
expenditures for local governments that purchase fully insured health benefit plans may 
increase. Revenues are not affected.  
 
Small Business Effect:  Potential meaningful.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Definitions 
 
The definition of “health care service” is expanded to include a health or medical care 
procedure or service rendered by a health care provider that provides any other care, 
service, or treatment of disease or injury, the correction of defects, or the maintenance of 
physical or mental well-being of human beings. Additionally, the definition of “adverse 
decision” is expanded to include a utilization review determination based on a prior 
authorization or step therapy requirement.  
 
“Course of treatment” means treatment that (1) is prescribed to treat or ordered for the 
treatment of an insured with a specific condition; (2) is outlined and agreed to by the 
insured and the health care provider before the treatment begins; and (3) may be part of a 
treatment plan.  
 
“Active course of treatment” means a course of treatment for which an insured is actively 
seeing a health care provider and following the course of treatment.  
 
Establishment of Online Processes 
 
By July 1, 2026, carriers must establish and maintain an online process that can (1) link 
directly to all e-prescribing systems and electronic health record systems that use specified 
standards; (2) accept electronic prior authorization requests from a health care provider; 
(3) approve electronic prior authorization requests, as specified; and (4) link directly to 
real-time patient out-of-pocket costs and more affordable medication alternatives made 
available by the carrier. A carrier may not impose a fee or charge on a person for accessing 
the online process. Additionally, a carrier may not access health care provider data via the 
online process other than for the insured or enrollee, without consent.  
 
By July 1, 2025, a carrier must (1) post the contact information for each third-party vendor 
or other entity that the carrier will use to establish the online process on its website and 
(2) on the request of a health care provider, provide the contact information for each 
third-party vendor or other entity.  
 
By July 1, 2026, each health care provider must ensure that the e-prescribing system or 
electronic health record system they use has the ability to access, at the point of prescribing, 
(1) the electronic prior authorization process established by a carrier and (2) the real-time 
patient out-of-pocket cost information and available medication alternatives.  
 

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
HB 932/ Page 3 
By July 1, 2026, each carrier, or pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) on behalf of the carrier, 
must provide real-time patient specific benefit information to insureds and enrollees and 
contracted health care providers. A carrier or PBM must ensure the information provided 
is accurate and delivered in an accessible and understandable format, as specified.  
 
Prior Authorization for Prescription Drugs 
 
The bill requires that, on receipt of information documenting a prior authorization from the 
insured or the insured’s health care provider, a carrier must honor a prior authorization 
granted from a previous entity for at least the lesser of 90 days or the length of the course 
of treatment.  
 
A carrier may not require a health care provider to submit a request for another prior 
authorization for a prescription drug if (1) the insured changes health benefit plans that are 
both covered by the same carrier and the prescription drug is a covered benefit under the 
current health benefit plan or (2) the dosage for the approved prescription drug changes 
and the change is consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label dosages 
(the prohibition does not apply for a dosage change for an opioid).  
 
The bill repeals the requirement that a carrier, when issuing an adverse decision denying 
coverage for a prescription drug, must provide a detailed written explanation for the denial 
of coverage.  
 
Restrictions on Issuing an Adverse Decision:  A carrier may not issue an adverse decision 
on a reauthorization for the same prescription drug or request additional documentation 
from the prescriber for the reauthorization request if the following is true:   
 
 
the prescription drug is (1) an immune globulin (human) as defined in 21 C.F.R.  
§ 640.100 or (2) used for the treatment of a mental disorder, as specified;  
 
the carrier previously approved a prior authorization for the prescription drug for 
the insured;  
 
the insured has been treated with the prescription drug without interruption since 
the initial approval of the prior authorization; and  
 
the prescriber attests that, based on the prescriber’s professional judgment, the 
prescription drug continues to be necessary to effectively treat the insured.  
 
Notice Requirements:  If the prescription drug that is being requested has been removed 
from the formulary or moved to a higher deductible, copayment, or coinsurance tier, the 
carrier must provide the insured and the insured’s health care provider with notice of the 
change at least 30 days in advance. The notice must include the process for requesting an 
exemption, as specified.  
 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
HB 932/ Page 4 
If a carrier implements a new prior authorization requirement for a prescription drug, the 
carrier must provide notice at least 60 days before implementation of the new requirement. 
The carrier’s notice must indicate that the insured may remain on the prescription drug at 
the time of reauthorization if the conditions specified above exist.  
 
Prior Authorization of a Course of Treatment 
 
Specified entities must approve a request for the prior authorization of a course of treatment 
that is (1) for a period of time that is as long as necessary to avoid disruption in care and 
(2) determined in accordance with applicable coverage criteria, the insured’s medical 
history, and the health care provider’s recommendation. For new enrollees, specified 
entities may not disrupt or require reauthorization for an active course of treatment for 
covered services until at least 90 days after the enrollment date.  
 
These provisions apply to (1) an insurer, nonprofit health service plan, or HMO that 
provides hospital, medical, or surgical benefits; (2) an insurer, nonprofit health service 
plan, or HMO that contracts with a private review agent; and (3) an insurer, nonprofit health 
service plan, or HMO that contracts with a third party to dispense medical devices, 
appliances, or goods.  
 
Internal Grievance Procedures 
 
Emergency Cases:  The bill repeals a provision requiring that regulations issued by the 
Insurance Commissioner are the basis for whether a grievance is considered an emergency 
case. Instead, a carrier must initiate the expedited procedures required for an emergency 
case if (1) the member or the member’s representative requests the expedited review or 
(2) the health care provider, or the member or the member’s representative, attests that the 
adverse decision was rendered for health care services that are proposed but have not been 
provided and the services are necessary to treat a condition or illness that, without 
immediate medical attention, would seriously jeopardize a member’s life or health, cause 
the member to be a danger to the member’s self or others, or cause the member to continue 
using intoxicating substances in an imminently dangerous manner.  
 
Nonemergency Cases:  For nonemergency cases, when a carrier renders an adverse 
decision, the carrier’s written notice to the member, the member’s representative, and the 
health care provider acting on behalf of the member must include the reasoning used to 
determine that the health care service is not medically necessary and did not meet the 
carrier’s criteria and standards used in conducting the utilization review. The written notice 
must also provide the specific reference, language, or requirements from the criteria and 
standards on which the decision was based and may not solely use language directing the 
member to review the additional coverage criteria in the member’s policy or plan 
documents. Finally, the business telephone number provided in the written notice must be 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 932/ Page 5 
a dedicated number for adverse decisions. Similar requirements apply when a carrier issues 
a nonemergency grievance decision.  
 
Incomplete Grievances:  If a member, a member’s representative, or a health care provider 
on behalf of the member files a grievance with a carrier and the carrier lacks sufficient 
information to complete its internal grievance process, the carrier must take specified 
actions within five working days of the grievance being filed. In addition to other actions 
required under current law, after confirming through a complete review of any information 
already submitted by the health care provider, the carrier must (1) request the specific 
information that must be submitted to complete the internal grievance process and 
(2) provide the specific reference, language, or requirements from the criteria and standards 
used by the carrier to support the need for the additional information.  
 
Additional Reporting Requirements 
 
In its quarterly reports to the Commissioner describing its activities regarding grievance 
decisions, a carrier must, in addition to complying with existing reporting requirements, 
include the following information:  (1) whether an adverse decision issued by the carrier 
involved a prior authorization or step therapy protocol; (2) the number of adverse decisions 
overturned after a reconsideration request; and (3) the number of requests made and granted 
for nonformulary prescription drugs.  
 
The Commissioner, when compiling an annual summary report for the Governor and 
General Assembly from the information provided by carriers, must report any violations 
by a private review agent.  
 
Private Review Agents 
 
Certificate of Registration:  A private review agent applying for a certificate of registration 
from the Commissioner must attest that the criteria and standards to be used in conducting 
utilization review are generally recognized by health care providers practicing in the 
relevant clinical specialties and are:   
 
 
objective and clinically valid (as specified under current law);  
 
reflected in published peer-reviewed scientific studies and medical literature;  
 
developed by specified entities;  
 
recommended by federal agencies;  
 
approved by FDA as part of drug labeling;  
 
taking into account the needs of atypical patient populations and diagnoses;  
 
sufficiently flexible to allow deviations from norms when justified on a case-by-case 
basis;  

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 932/ Page 6 
 
ensuring quality of care of health care services;  
 
reviewed, evaluated, and updated at least annually and as necessary to reflect any 
changes; and  
 
in compliance with any other criteria and standards required for coverage, as 
specified.  
 
A private review agent applying for a certificate of registration must submit (1) if 
applicable, any provisions by which patients, or physicians, hospitals, or other health care 
practitioners may seek reconsideration; and (2) a list of the persons involved in establishing 
the specific criteria and standards to be used in conducting utilization review, including 
each person’s board certifications or practice specialty, licensure category, and title within 
the person’s organization.  
 
Posting a Copy of Utilization Review Criteria and Standards:  A private review agent must 
post the specific criteria and standards to be used in conducting utilization review, as well 
as any subsequent revisions, modifications, or additions, on its website or the carrier’s 
website. A private review agent may not charge a fee to provide this information, with the 
exception of a reasonable fee to provide the information in hard copy format.  
 
Making Determinations:  The bill alters or adds the following requirements for a private 
review agent:   
 
 
A private review agent must make all initial determinations on whether to authorize 
or certify a nonemergency course of treatment or health care service, including 
pharmaceutical services not submitted electronically, within two working days after 
receipt of the information necessary to make the determination.  
 
A private review agent must make all determinations to authorize or certify a request 
for additional visits or days of care submitted as part of an existing course of 
treatment or treatment plan within one working day after receipt of the information 
necessary to make the determination.  
 
If after receipt of an initial request for health care services, and confirming through 
a complete review of information already submitted by the health care provider, a 
private review agent does not have sufficient information to make a determination, 
the private review agent must promptly, and within three calendar days after receipt 
of the initial request, inform the health care provider that additional information 
must be provided by specifying the information that must be submitted to complete 
the request and the criteria and standards to support the need for additional 
information.  
 
If a private review agent needs additional information to determine whether to 
authorize or certify an inpatient admission, or an admission for residential crisis 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 932/ Page 7 
services, for the treatment of a mental, emotional, or substance abuse disorder, the 
private review agent must promptly request the specific information needed.  
 
For electronic submissions of a step therapy exception request or a prior 
authorization request for pharmaceutical services, if a private review agent does not 
have sufficient information to make a determination, the private review agent, after 
confirming through a complete review of the information submitted by the health 
care provider, must request the information promptly, within three calendar days of 
receiving the initial request, by specifying the information that must be submitted 
to complete the request and the criteria and standards to support the need for 
additional information.  
 
Except as specified, a private review agent must make initial determinations on 
whether to authorize or certify an emergency course of treatment or health care 
service for a member within 24 hours of the initial request after receipt of the 
information necessary to make the request. If the private review agent needs 
additional information after confirming through a complete review of the 
information already submitted by the health care provider, the private review agent 
must promptly request the specific information needed and within 2 hours after 
receipt of the information, notify the health care provider of the authorization or 
certification determination.  
 
A private review agent must initiate the expedited procedure for an emergency case 
if the patient or the patient’s representative requests or if the health care provider 
attests that the services are necessary to treat a condition or illness that, without 
immediate medical attention, would seriously jeopardize a member’s life or health, 
cause the member to be a danger to the member’s self or others, or cause the member 
to continue using intoxicating substances in an imminently dangerous manner.  
 
If a private review agent fails to make a determination within the time limits required, the 
request is deemed approved.  
 
Health Care Provider Access to Physician That Rendered Adverse Decision:  The bill 
specifies that if an initial determination is made by a private review agent not to authorize 
or certify a health care service and the health care provider believes the determination 
warrants immediate reconsideration, the private review agent must give the health care 
provider the opportunity to speak with the physician that rendered the determination, by 
telephone on an expedited basis, within 24 hours of the health care provider seeking the 
reconsideration.  
 
If the physician is unable to immediately speak with the health care provider seeking the 
reconsideration, the physician must provide the health care provider with specified contact 
information that the health care provider can use to contact the physician.  
 

END OF PAGE 7

START OF PAGE 8
    
HB 932/ Page 8 
Qualification of Physician on Panel Who Renders Adverse Decisions:  The bill specifies 
that at least one licensed physician on the panel who renders an adverse decision, in 
addition to being board certified or eligible in the same specialty as the treatment under 
review, must be knowledgeable about the requested health care service or treatment 
through actual clinical experience. When the health care service under review is a dental 
service, the adverse decision must be made by a licensed dentist, or a panel of other 
appropriate health care service reviewers with at least one licensed dentist on the panel who 
is knowledgeable about the required health care service or treatment through actual 
clinical experience.  
 
Reports, Studies, and Workgroups Required under the Bill 
 
Development of Standards for Payor Programs:  Uncodified language requires MHCC and 
MIA, in consultation with health care practitioners and payors, to jointly conduct a study 
on the development of standards for the implementation of payor programs to modify prior 
authorization requirements for prescriptions drugs, medical care, and other health care 
services based on health care practitioner-specific criteria. The study must include an 
analysis of (1) adjustments to payor prior authorization requirements based on a health care 
practitioner’s prior approval rates, ordering and prescribing patterns, and participation in a 
payor’s two-sided incentive arrangement or a capitation program and (2) any other 
information or metrics necessary to implement the payor programs.  
 
By December 1, 2024, MHCC and MIA must submit a report to the General Assembly that 
details their findings and recommendations from the study, including recommendations for 
legislative initiatives necessary for the establishment of payor programs modifying prior 
authorization requirements based on health care practitioner-specific criteria.  
 
Assessment of Implementation of an Online Electronic Process for Prior Authorization:  
Uncodified language requires MHCC, in consultation with MIA, to monitor the progress 
toward implementing the bill’s requirements regarding an online electronic process for 
prior authorization (including monitoring any federal or State developments relating to the 
requirements) and review issues or recommendations from other states that are 
implementing a real-time benefit requirement. By December 1, 2025, MHCC must inform 
the General Assembly of any findings and recommendations relating to the implementation 
of the bill’s requirements regarding an online electronic process for prior authorization.  
 
Current Law:   
 
Definitions 
 
“Adverse decision” means a utilization review determination made by a private review 
agent, carrier, or health care provider that a proposed or delivered health care service is or 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 932/ Page 9 
was not medically necessary, appropriate, or efficient and may result in noncoverage of the 
health care service. An adverse decision does not include a decision concerning a 
subscriber’s status as a member.  
 
“Grievance decision” means a final determination by a carrier or private review agent that 
arises from a grievance filed with the carrier or private review agent under its internal 
grievance process regarding an adverse decision concerning a member or patient.  
 
“Health care service” means a health or medical care procedure or service rendered by a 
health care provider that (1) provides testing, diagnosis, or treatment of a human disease or 
dysfunction or (2) dispenses drugs, medical devices, medical appliances, or medical goods 
for the treatment of a human disease or dysfunction.  
 
A “private review agent” means a (1) nonhospital-affiliated person or entity performing 
utilization review that is either affiliated with, under contract with, or acting on behalf of a 
Maryland business entity or a third party that pays for, provides, or administers health care 
services to citizens of the State or (2) any person or entity performing utilization review 
for the purpose of making claims or payment decisions for health care services on behalf 
of the employer’s or labor union’s health insurance plan under an employee assistance 
program for employees other than the employees employed by the hospital or a business 
wholly owned by the hospital.  
 
“Utilization review” means a system for reviewing the appropriate and efficient allocation 
of health care resources and services given or proposed to be given to a patient or group of 
patients.  
 
Benchmarks for Standardizing and Automating Preauthorization of Health Care Services 
 
MHCC must work with payors and providers to attain specified benchmarks for 
standardizing and automating the process required by payors for preauthorizing health care 
services and overriding a payor’s step therapy or fail-first protocol, including an online 
preauthorization system, as specified.  
 
Prior Authorization for Prescription Drugs 
 
Chapter 549 of 2019 established requirements for prior authorization for a prescription for 
a chronic condition and requires specified entities to (1) maintain a database of information 
relating to prior authorization requests filed electronically; (2) provide a detailed written 
explanation when denying a prior authorization; (3) honor prior authorizations granted to 
an insured from a previous entity for at least the initial 30 days of an insured’s prescription 
drug benefit coverage under the new entity’s health benefit plan; and (4) provide written 

END OF PAGE 9

START OF PAGE 10
    
HB 932/ Page 10 
notice of any new prior authorization requirement the entity implements for a prescription 
drug at least 30 days prior to implementation.  
 
If a carrier requires a prior authorization for a prescription drug, the prior authorization 
request must allow a health care provider to indicate whether a prescription drug is to be 
used to treat a chronic condition. If a health care provider indicates as such, a carrier may 
not request a reauthorization for a repeat prescription for one year or for the standard course 
of treatment for the chronic condition, whichever is less.  
 
Internal Grievance Procedures 
 
Each carrier must establish for its members an internal grievance process, which must meet 
specified requirements.  
 
A carrier must render a final decision in writing on a grievance within 30 working days 
after the date on which the grievance is filed unless a specified exception applies. For a 
grievance that involves a retrospective denial, a carrier must render a final decision in 
writing within 45 working days after the date on which the grievance is filed. A carrier may 
extend the 30-day or 45-day period required for making a final grievance decision with the 
written consent of the member, the member’s representative, or the health care provider 
who filed the grievance.  
 
A member, a member’s representative, or a health care provider may file a complaint with 
the Commissioner if a grievance decision is not received from the carrier by the 
thirtieth working day on which the grievance is filed.  
 
If a carrier does not have sufficient information to complete its internal grievance process, 
the carrier must, within five working days after a grievance has been filed, notify the 
member, the member’s representative, or the health care provider who filed the grievance 
that it cannot proceed with reviewing the grievance unless additional information is 
provided. Additionally, the carrier must assist the member, the member’s representative, 
or the health care provider in gathering the necessary information without further delay. 
 
For nonemergency cases, when a carrier renders an adverse decision, the carrier must 
document the decision in writing after the carrier has provided oral communication of the 
decision to the member, the member’s representative, or the health care provider acting on 
behalf of the member. The written notice must be sent to the member, the member’s 
representative, or the health care provider acting on behalf of the member within 
five working days after the decision has been made. The written notice must state in 
detail – using clear, understandable language – the specific factual basis for the carrier’s 
decision and reference the specific criteria and standards on which the grievance decision 
was based. Additionally, the notice must state the name, business address, and business 

END OF PAGE 10

START OF PAGE 11
    
HB 932/ Page 11 
telephone number of the designated employee or representative who has responsibility for 
the carrier’s internal grievance process (or the medical director who made the grievance 
decision if the carrier is an HMO).  
 
In an emergency case, a carrier must include an expedited procedure that can be used to 
render a grievance decision within 24 hours of the date the grievance is filed with the 
carrier. A carrier must provide written notice of a grievance decision to the member, the 
member’s representative, or the health care provider within one day after orally 
communicating the decision to that individual. The notice must include the same 
information that is provided for a grievance decision rendered in a nonemergency case.  
 
On a quarterly basis, each carrier must submit a report to the Commissioner that describes 
specified activities, including the number of adverse decisions issued by the carrier and the 
type of service at issue in those adverse decisions.  
 
Private Review Agents 
 
Certificate of Registration:  A private review agent may not conduct utilization review in 
the State unless the Commissioner has granted the private review agent a certificate of 
registration. When applying for a certificate, a private review agent must certify that the 
criteria and standards to be used in conducting utilization review are objective, clinically 
valid, compatible with established principles of health care, and flexible enough to allow 
deviations from norms when justified on a case-by-case basis.  
 
A private review agent may not use criteria and standards for utilization review that do not 
meet these requirements. A person who knowingly uses criteria and standards to conduct 
utilization review that do not meet these requirements is guilty of a misdemeanor and on 
conviction is subject to specified penalties.  
 
A private review agent applying for a certificate of registration must also submit specified 
information that the Commissioner requires, including a list of the persons involved in 
establishing the specific criteria and standards to be used in conducting utilization review. 
The Commissioner may establish reporting requirements to evaluate the effectiveness of 
private review agents and determine if utilization review programs are in compliance with 
applicable State law and regulations.  
 
Providing a Copy of Utilization Review Criteria and Standards:  On the written request of 
any person or health care facility, a private review agent must provide one copy of the 
specific criteria and standards to be used in conducting utilization review of proposed or 
delivered services and any subsequent revisions, modifications, or additions to the specific 
criteria and standards to be used in conducting utilization review of such services. A private 

END OF PAGE 11

START OF PAGE 12
    
HB 932/ Page 12 
review agent is entitled to charge a reasonable fee to furnish a copy of the utilization review 
criteria and standards.  
 
Making Determinations:  A private review agent must comply with the following timelines 
and requirements:   
 
 
make all initial determinations on whether to authorize or certify a nonemergency 
course of treatment for a patient within two working days after receipt of the 
information necessary to make the determination;  
 
make all determinations on whether to authorize or certify an extended stay in a 
health care facility or additional health care services within one working day after 
receipt of the information necessary to make the determination;  
 
if within three calendar days after receipt of the initial request for health care 
services the private review agent does not have sufficient information to make a 
determination, the private review agent must inform the health care provider that 
additional information must be provided;  
 
if a private review agent requires prior authorization for an emergency inpatient 
admission, or an admission for residential crisis services, for the treatment of a 
mental, emotional, or substance use disorder, the private review agent must make 
all determinations within two hours after receipt of the information necessary to 
make the decision and must promptly notify the health care provider of the 
determination; and  
 
for electronic submissions of a step therapy exception request or a prior 
authorization request for pharmaceutical services, a private review agent must make 
a determination in real time if no additional information is needed to process the 
request and the request meets the private review agent’s criteria for approval. If 
additional information is required to make a determination, a private review agent 
must make the determination within one working day of receiving that information 
and must promptly notify the health care provider of the determination.  
 
If a private review agent makes an initial determination not to authorize or certify a health 
care service and the health care provider believes the determination warrants an immediate 
reconsideration, the private review agent may grant the health care provider an opportunity 
to speak with the physician that rendered the determination. The health care provider and 
physician must speak within 24 hours of the provider seeking the reconsideration.  
 
Adverse Decisions:  Except as otherwise specified, all adverse decisions must be made by 
a physician or a panel of other appropriate health care service reviewers with at least 
one physician on the panel who is board certified or eligible in the same specialty as the 
treatment under review.

HB 932/ Page 13 
State Expenditures:  The State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits 
Program is largely self-insured for its medical contracts and, as such, except for the 
one fully insured integrated health model medical plan (Kaiser), is not subject to this bill. 
However, the program generally provides coverage as otherwise required under State law.  
 
The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) advises that the bill’s requirements 
increase annual costs to the program by $3.5 million due to the requirement to cover prior 
authorizations for prescription drugs for immune globulins (human) and qualifying mental 
disorders.  
 
The Department of Legislative Services advises that, if DBM elects to comply with the 
bill’s requirements, program costs increase by $1.75 million in fiscal 2025, to reflect the 
bill’s January 1, 2025 effective date, and $3.5 million annually thereafter.  
 
Small Business Effect:  Small business health care providers experience reduced 
administrative burdens under the bill. Due to the bill’s changes to the utilization review 
process, premiums for small businesses that purchase fully insured health benefit plans 
may increase.
