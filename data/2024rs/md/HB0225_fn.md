growth policy” under those provisions to mean the State Economic Growth, Resource 
Protection, and Planning Policy set forth in § 5-7A-01 of the State Finance and 
Procurement Article. Section 5-7A-01, under current law, establishes specified policy 
goals in the following areas:  (1) quality of life and sustainability; (2) public participation; 
(3) growth areas; (4) community design; (5) infrastructure; (6) transportation; (7) housing; 
(8) economic development; (9) environmental protection; (10) resource conservation; 
(11) stewardship; and (12) implementation. The bill also replaces the term “neighborhood 
conservation” with “neighborhood vitality” under several provisions. 
 
The bill (1) makes the Secretary of Planning the chair of the Sustainable Growth 
Subcabinet (replacing the Special Secretary of Smart Growth) and the Secretary of Housing 
and Community Development the vice chair, and (2) adds the Secretary of Emergency 
Management to the subcabinet. The bill also requires MDP to provide primary staff support 
for the Subcabinet (replacing the Office of Smart Growth) and serve as its primary office. 
 
The bill modifies existing duties of the subcabinet by replacing “smart growth” with 
“equitable and resilient growth” as one of areas to be covered – along with development, 
neighborhood vitality, and resource management – in subcabinet discussions of local 
government issues with local elected leaders and planning officials. A requirement that the 
subcabinet work together to create, enhance, support, and revitalize sustainable 
communities across the State is modified to also refer to equitable (in addition to 
sustainable) communities. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Office of Smart Growth 
 
Chapter 566 of 2001 established (1) the State’s commitment to addressing the high 
financial, social, and environmental costs of sprawl development through effective smart 
growth policy and (2) the Office of Smart Growth to articulate, coordinate, and implement 
smart growth policy for the residents of the State. Chapter 566 also established the position 
of the Special Secretary of Smart Growth as the head of the office and the chair of the 
Smart Growth Subcabinet (discussed below). 
 
The office’s powers and duties are to:   
 
 
review State assistance programs related to smart growth to determine their 
applicability, if any, to projects that are consistent with the State’s smart growth 
policy; 
 
promote interagency consensus and cooperation on projects that are consistent with 
the State’s smart growth policy and resolve conflicting agency positions on projects 
in an expedited manner;



projects; 
 
gather and disseminate information to the public, including local jurisdictions, 
nonprofit organizations, and developers on how to develop projects that are 
consistent with the State’s smart growth policy; 
 
provide a single point of access for members of the public, including local 
jurisdictions, 
nonprofit 
organizations, 
developers, 
and 
community 
and 
homeowners’ associations who need assistance or guidance in navigating the 
processes and regulations of State agencies on projects that are consistent with the 
State’s smart growth policy; 
 
work with local governments in expediting review of projects that both the local 
government and the State agree are consistent with the State’s smart growth policy; 
 
provide effective public information on smart growth programs and educational 
activities, including relationships with the National Center for Smart Growth 
Education and Research at the University of Maryland, College Park Campus, and 
coordination of smart growth outreach efforts to local governments, the general 
public, and other interest groups; 
 
coordinate the efforts of the Executive Branch to provide input to the 
General Assembly on legislation that concerns smart growth and neighborhood 
conservation; and 
 
in coordination with the Smart Growth Subcabinet, recommend to the Governor 
changes to State law and regulations necessary to advance the policy of smart 
growth. 
 
Smart Growth Subcabinet  
 
In statute, the Smart Growth Subcabinet is comprised of the Special Secretary of Smart 
Growth and the secretaries of specified State agencies, including the Secretary of Planning 
and the Secretary of Housing and Community Development. The Special Secretary of 
Smart Growth chairs the subcabinet and is responsible for the oversight, direction, and 
accountability of its work, and the Secretary of Planning is the vice chair. Statute requires 
the Office of Smart Growth to provide primary staff support for the subcabinet. 
 
The subcabinet must:   
 
 
provide a forum for discussion of interdepartmental issues relating to activities that 
affect growth, development, neighborhood conservation, and resource management; 
 
work together to promote the understanding of smart growth; 
 
work together to create, enhance, support, and revitalize sustainable communities 
across the State;

HB 225/ Page 4 
 
meet at least biannually with county and municipal elected leaders and planning 
officials to discuss local government issues relating to activities that affect smart 
growth, development, neighborhood conservation, and resource management; 
 
make recommendations to specified State agencies; 
 
evaluate and report annually to the Governor and the General Assembly on the 
implementation of the State’s smart growth policy; and 
 
perform other duties assigned by the Governor.  
 
Background:  MDP indicates that the bill updates and modernizes the Smart Growth 
Subcabinet to be the Sustainable Growth Subcabinet with a slightly broadened charge and 
a clearer organizational structure, focused on sustainable growth. The subcabinet 
coordinates the work of the subcabinet agencies, and MDP indicates that the bill does not 
increase departmental responsibilities of any of the agencies, including the department. The 
department indicates that it is the main agency that staffs the subcabinet, and making the 
Secretary of Planning the chair, and the Secretary of Housing and Community 
Development the vice chair, aligns with the subcabinet’s mission and staffing 
requirements.
