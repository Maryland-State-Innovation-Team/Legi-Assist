Analysis 
 
Current Law:  
 
Truancy Reduction Pilot Program 
 
Under § 7-301 of the Education Article, subject to limited exceptions, each child who 
resides in the State and is age 5 or older and younger than age 18 must attend a public 
school regularly during the entire school year. A child who is required by law to attend 
school and is habitually truant can be designated a Child in Need of Supervision, which 
makes the child subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Title 3, Subtitle 8A 
of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. However, current law (Title 3, Subtitle 8C 
of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article) also sets forth specific procedures for 
addressing truancy in jurisdictions in which a TRPP has been established. In a county in 
which a TRPP has been established, an authorized school official may file with the juvenile 
court a petition alleging that a child who is required to attend school failed to do so without 
lawful excuse, as specified. 
 
Circuit Administrative Judges of the First, Second, Third, and Seventh circuits may 
establish TRPPs in specified counties within their judicial circuits. Dorchester, Harford, 
Kent, Prince George’s, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester counties are currently 
authorized to have TRPPs. 
 
Dispositions under a Truancy Program 
 
When making a disposition on a petition that has been filed as part of a TRPP, the court 
may order the child to (1) attend school; (2) perform community service; (3) attend 
counseling, including family counseling; (4) attend substance abuse evaluation and 
treatment; (5) attend mental health evaluation and treatment; or (6) keep a curfew with the 
hours set by the court. The court must retain jurisdiction until every condition of the court’s 
order is satisfied. 
 
Truancy Programs – Adults 
 
Section 7-301 of the Education Article also requires a person who has legal custody or care 
and control of a child who is at least age 5, but younger than age 16, to see that the child 
attends school or receives instruction. A violator is guilty of a misdemeanor. For a 
first conviction, the violator is subject to maximum penalties of a fine of $50 per unlawful 
day of absence and/or three days imprisonment. For a second or subsequent conviction, the 
violator is subject to maximum penalties of a fine of $100 per day of unlawful absence 
and/or five days imprisonment.

SB 1039/ Page 3 
Any person who induces or attempts to induce a child to be unlawfully absent from school 
or employs or harbors any child who is absent unlawfully from school while school is in 
session is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500 and/or imprisonment 
for up to 30 days. In a county that has established a TRPP, a charge may be filed in the 
juvenile court and assigned to a truancy docket for disposition. The court may condition 
marking a charge as a stet on the defendant’s participation in the appropriate TRPP.  
 
Annual Reporting Requirements 
 
The Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of Maryland must report annually (by November 1) 
to the General Assembly on each established TRPP.  
 
State and Local Fiscal Effect:  The Judiciary’s Office of Problem-Solving Courts (OPSC) 
advises that it provides annual reimbursable grants to each circuit court that operates a 
truancy program, and $155,000 is the standard annual anticipated cost for a truancy 
program. OPSC previously advised that county supporting agencies do provide support 
staff or services where needed for TRPPs (e.g., a pupil placement worker provided by a 
local school board). However, both Frederick County and Frederick County Public Schools 
advise they do not anticipate a fiscal impact from the bill, and any involvement with a 
TRPP can be handled with existing resources.  
 
OPD previously advised that truancy programs generate additional cases based on charges 
against parents for truant behavior and increased level of effort in juvenile cases with 
clients who have both a delinquency matter and a truancy matter, to ensure that their rights 
are protected. To the extent that this occurs in Frederick County, the bill has an operational 
effect on OPD. Additional OPD workloads generated solely by the bill can only be 
determined with actual experience under the bill. Should the addition of a truancy program 
in Frederick County increase OPD workloads such that additional personnel are needed, 
OPD can request those additional resources through the annual budget process.
