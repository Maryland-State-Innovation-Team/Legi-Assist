FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
Senate Bill 982 
(Senator Hester, et al.) 
Education, Energy, and the Environment and 
Budget and Taxation 
Health and Government Operations and 
Appropriations 
 
Information Technology - Modernization of Information Technology Projects 
 
 
This bill makes various changes to the State’s governance, oversight, funding, and 
management of information technology (IT) projects, including (1) requiring various 
entities to undertake specified research and planning activities and complete various plans 
and reports; (2) renaming, modifying, and expanding the Major IT Development Project 
(MITDP) Fund; and (3) establishing a process to fund “expedited projects.” The bill takes 
effect July 1, 2024.  
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  General and special fund expenditures increase by $2.1 million in FY 2025 
for staff and contractual costs. Future years reflect inflation, the elimination of one-time 
costs, and ongoing consultant costs of $200,000 every other year beginning in FY 2026. 
General fund expenditures, special fund revenues, and special fund expenditures may be 
affected to the extent that additional funding is required for MITDPs and to the extent that 
a revolving loan process is established; however, these potential impacts are not shown 
below. Revenues are not directly affected. This bill establishes a mandated 
appropriation beginning in FY 2026.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  The bill establishes the intent of the General Assembly that oversight of 
IT be centralized in the Department of Information Technology (DoIT), and that priority 
be given to funding IT projects to address the needs for the public health, education, safety, 
or financial well-being of Maryland residents. In broad terms, with additional detail 
provided below, the bill also:   
 
 
requires the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee (JAEC), in consultation with the 
Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Biotechnology 
(JCCIB) to study and make recommendations related to issues identified in the most 
recent audit of DoIT; 
 
clarifies that IT includes networking and software applications and that a unit of 
State government may not purchase, lease, or rent IT unless consistent with the 
master plan, as determined by the Secretary; 
 
establishes numerous new study, planning, and reporting responsibilities for the 
Secretary and DoIT related to IT modernization; 
 
requires the Department of General Services (DGS) to hire a consultant to assess 
the State’s process for procuring IT; 
 
renames the MITDP Fund to be the Information Technology Investment Fund 
(ITIF); 
 
redefines what constitutes an MITDP, creates and defines a new “expedited project” 
category, and modifies how ITIF funds may be used to fund both project types; 
 
requires at least 20% of the funding appropriated to ITIF each year to be set aside 
for expedited projects; 
 
modifies the process by which State agencies request approval for IT projects from 
DoIT, and strengthens DoIT’s oversight of any such projects; 
 
renames the Modernize Maryland Oversight Commission (MMOC) to be the 
Modernize Maryland Commission (MMC) and modifies its purpose, membership, 
and responsibilities; and  
 
requires additional staff for DoIT. 
 
Study on Audit Findings 
 
By December 1, 2024, JAEC must, in consultation with JCCIB, study and make 
recommendations for any statutory or operational changes necessary to address findings of 
the audit issued on April 2, 2024, by the Office of Legislative Audits in the Department of 
Legislative Services (DLS), and report on any recommendations for statutory changes to 
the Governor and General Assembly, as specified.

Modernization Project Procurements, Inventories, Plans, and Reports 
 
DGS must, in consultation with DoIT, hire a consultant to assess the procurement process 
for IT projects involving modernization and make recommendations to increase the State’s 
ability to proceed with a modernization project in a rapid and responsive manner. The bill 
does not specify a deadline for completion of the assessment. 
 
By July 1, 2025, DoIT must inventory and assess the State’s legacy systems, as defined by 
the bill, and prioritize modernization. By January 1, 2026, and every other January 1 
thereafter, DoIT, in consultation with every unit of State government, must submit a report 
to the Governor, the Secretary, and the General Assembly that provides an estimate of the 
funding required to modernize each legacy system in each unit and a five-year projection 
of funding required to modernize each legacy system. 
 
DoIT must consult with MMC to:   
 
 
develop standards for units of State government to assist in identifying legacy 
systems that require modernization projects appropriate to be financed as an 
expedited project through ITIF; 
 
adopt an IT Investment Maturity Model, as specified; and 
 
develop a State Modernization Plan. 
 
By December 1, 2025, the Secretary must:   
 
 
develop a State Modernization Plan that includes specified information, including 
high level timeframe and cost estimates; 
 
develop a strategy for centralization of IT management across the Executive Branch 
of State government under DoIT; and 
 
identify positions in DoIT that would be suitable for independent salary setting 
authority or greater flexibility in position classification to ensure that DoIT can 
recruit and retain the necessary staff to meet its mission.  
 
A contract to modernize an IT system or to proceed with an expedited project must be 
expedited for approval by the Board of Public Works and placed on the agenda as soon as 
practicable.  
 
Information Technology Project Requests 
 
Instead of designating eligible projects as MITDPs when submitting IT project requests to 
DoIT, a unit of State government must instead submit information in support of the project 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
SB 982/ Page 4 
request to the Secretary for review and determination before submitting its IT project 
requests. 
 
The Secretary must make a recommendation to the Secretary of Budget and Management 
to withhold project funds, regardless of fund source, if (1) a unit of State government is not 
consistently reporting on the status of a project or projects to DoIT in the form and manner 
required by DoIT or (2) DoIT determines that project implementation issues exist, 
including specified issues of concern that could jeopardize successful implementation.  
 
Major Information Technology Development Project Fund and Expedited Projects 
 
The MITDP Fund is renamed to be ITIF and the purpose of the fund is expanded to include 
supporting expedited projects. The bill makes a series of conforming changes to existing 
requirements related to the funding of MITDPs to also include expedited projects and 
requires project funding decisions to be included in DoIT’s annual report about the fund. 
“Expedited project” means a project that is not an MITDP that receives money from the 
fund in a manner that allows for modernization projects consistent with the State 
Modernization Plan to move forward in a nimble and expedited manner. Each fiscal year, 
at least 20% of the amount included in the Governor’s allowance and appropriated to ITIF 
must be set aside for expedited projects. Any amount set aside that is not used in the 
fiscal year must remain set aside in the fund and available for future expedited projects. 
The Governor must submit with the State budget the amount proposed to be set aside for 
expedited projects. 
 
The authorized uses of funding in ITIF are expanded to include expedited projects and, for 
either MITDPs or expedited projects, a revolving loan process through which an agency 
may reimburse the fund in future fiscal years as established by the Secretary in regulation. 
 
The bill authorizes the Secretary to adopt regulations as necessary to implement existing 
provisions related to ITIF and requires the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to 
establish a process for units of State government to request and receive funding for an 
expedited project aligned with the State Modernization Plan that:   
 
 
allow units of State government to apply for project funding biannually; 
 
be consistent with the goals and preferences of State procurement law and 
encourage small and minority business enterprise vendors and 
 
provide measures that ensure compliance with the State Law and DoIT’s regulations 
by both vendors and units of State government. 
 
The Secretary may approve funding for MITDPs, expedited projects, and other 
expenditures from ITIF only when the projects are in compliance with statewide plans,

policies, and standards, as determined by the Secretary, and meet other existing 
requirements. 
 
Major Information Technology Development Projects and Oversight 
 
The bill increases the cost threshold, from $1.0 million to $5.0 million, required for an IT 
project to be considered an MITDP eligible for funding through ITIF. Also, the bill 
specifies that MITDPs do not include:   
 
 
technology that is reoccurring, standard operating technology as determined by the 
Secretary and submitted to the Legislative Policy Committee (LPC) for a 30-day 
review and comment period (statute does not require review by LPC for such 
projects); or 
 
projects with an estimated total cost of development that is (1) less than $5.0 million 
and is funded with money set aside for expedited projects in ITIF or (2) more than 
$5.0 million and is funded with money set aside for expedited projects in ITIF that 
meet other specified conditions. 
 
Modernize Maryland Commission 
 
MMOC is renamed to MMC and its purpose and existing duties are repealed; instead, the 
purpose of MMC is to ensure best practices related to the modernization and the 
replacement of legacy systems. To that end, MMC must:   
 
 
identify best practices for IT modernization and the replacement of legacy systems; 
 
provide recommendations for modernization of IT systems to the Governor, the 
Secretary, and the General Assembly; 
 
provide recommendations to promote transparency in modernization efforts in units 
of State government; and 
 
each year, submit a report of its findings and recommendations to specified 
committees of the General Assembly, the Governor, the Secretary, and the  
Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, IT, and Biotechnology. 
 
DoIT, in consultation with DLS, must staff the commission. 
 
Additional Staff Required 
 
Beginning in fiscal 2026, the Governor must include in the annual budget bill two position 
identification numbers and an appropriation in an amount sufficient to create two positions 
within DoIT to:   
 
 
assist in administering the process for units of State government to apply for 
expedited projects under the bill; and 

END OF PAGE 5

SB 982/ Page 6 
 
be a grants administrator responsible for aggressively seeking all possible federal or 
private grant funding to support MITDPs or expedited projects under the bill. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Secretary of Information Technology 
 
DoIT and the Secretary are responsible for:   
 
 
developing and enforcing IT policies, procedures, and standards; 
 
providing technical assistance, advice, and recommendations to any unit of State 
government; 
 
reviewing agency project plans to make information and services available to the 
public over the Internet; 
 
developing and maintaining a statewide IT Master Plan, as specified; 
 
developing a statewide cybersecurity strategy, as specified; 
 
adopting and enforcing nonvisual access standards to be used in the procurement of 
IT services, as specified; 
 
in consultation with the Maryland Cybersecurity Coordinating Council (MCCC), 
advising and overseeing a consistent cybersecurity strategy for units of State 
government, as specified; 
 
advising and consulting with the Legislative and Judicial branches of State 
government regarding a cybersecurity strategy; 
 
in consultation with MCCC, developing guidance on consistent cybersecurity 
strategies for specified local government entities; 
 
upgrading IT and cybersecurity-related State government infrastructure; and 
 
annually evaluating (1) the feasibility of units of State government providing public 
services using artificial intelligence, machine learning, commercial cloud computer 
services, device-as-a-service procurement models, and other emerging technologies 
and (2) the development of data analytics capabilities to enable data-driven 
policymaking by units of State government. 
 
“IT”

information 
processing, 
including 
maintenance, 
telecommunications, hardware, software, and associated services. 
 
Major Information Technology Development Projects 
 
In order to centralize State oversight and funding for major Executive Branch IT projects, 
Chapters 467 and 468 of 2002 established a review and approval process for MITDPs and 
the related MITDP Fund. The process and fund are both managed by DoIT. 
 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
SB 982/ Page 7 
For a project to be considered an MITDP, it must (1) be estimated to cost at least 
$1.0 million; (2) support critical business functions associated with the public health, 
education, safety, or financial well-being of the citizens of Maryland; or (3) be determined 
to require special attention and consideration by the Secretary. 
 
The MITDP Fund may be used to pay for MITDPs in general funded agencies, although 
MITDPs are often funded through other means (including federal funds). Among other 
sources of revenue, the fund consists of money received from IT agreements involving 
resource sharing, but certain government entities (including the Maryland Public 
Broadcasting Commission, as well as the Legislative and Judicial branches) are exempt 
from paying any money into the fund. Special funded agencies manage funding for their 
major IT projects, although their projects remain subject to the review, approval, and 
oversight of DoIT. 
 
Modernize Maryland Oversight Commission 
 
The purpose of MMOC is to (1) ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
information held by the State concerning State residents and (2) advise the Secretary and 
the State Chief Information Security Officer on appropriate IT and cybersecurity 
investments and upgrades, funding sources, and future procurement mechanisms, as 
specified. MMOC released its first annual report in December 2023. The commission must:   
 
 
advise the Secretary on a strategic roadmap with a timeline and budget that will 
(1) require updates and investments of critical IT and cybersecurity systems, as 
specified, to be completed by December 31, 2025, as specified and (2) require all 
updates and investments of IT and cybersecurity to be made by December 31, 2030; 
 
make periodic recommendations on investments in State IT structures based on 
required assessments; 
 
review and provide recommendations on DoIT’s basic security standards for use of 
the State’s broadband network; and 
 
each year, report its findings and recommendations to specified committees of the 
General Assembly. (This report may not contain information about the security of 
an information system.) 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  Many of the bill’s changes related to project funding and management 
are administrative or procedural in nature and not anticipated to affect total general or 
special fund expenditures, but other changes either affect the distribution of available 
funding and/or require additional expenditures, staff, or contractual support. 
 
DLS can handle the required study and reporting on specified DoIT audit issues using 
existing budgeted resources.

Information Technology Investment Fund 
 
Among the changes that likely have no direct fiscal effect are the renaming of the MITDP 
Fund to be ITIF, modifications to the authorized uses of funding for ITIF, changes to the 
MITDP approval and funding process (ITIF continues to fund MITDPs under the bill), and 
the establishment of a process by which expedited projects may receive funding from ITIF. 
 
However, the bill’s requirement that at least 20% of the funding appropriated to ITIF each 
year be set aside for expedited projects may require either (1) the redirection of funds from 
some ongoing projects that may have received partial installment funding and are expecting 
additional funding to support project completion or (2) additional general fund support to 
ensure that all eligible projects receive funding. While it is likely that some future projects 
that would receive funding under current law as an MITDP instead receive funding as an 
expedited project under the bill, other projects may not qualify for expedited project 
funding and may be cut or have their scope reduced to ensure that 20% of ITIF funds are 
available for expedited projects. Alternatively, general funds could be used to ensure any 
such projects also receive funding. To the extent general funds are provided, general fund 
expenditures, special fund revenues for ITIF, and special fund expenditures for ITIF 
increase correspondingly; however, any such impact is speculative and cannot be reliably 
estimated at this time.  
 
Department of Information Technology and Department of General Services 
 
General and special fund expenditures increase by $2.1 million in fiscal 2025, which 
reflects the bill’s July 1, 2024 effective date. This estimate reflects the cost of hiring one 
fiscal analyst and one grants administrator for DoIT beginning October 1, 2024. The bill 
requires these positions to be hired beginning in fiscal 2026, but this analysis assumes the 
staff begin working in fiscal 2025 to assist with implementing the bills various 
requirements, including staffing duties for MMC and assisting with the various required 
planning activities. It includes salaries, fringe benefits, one-time start-up costs, and ongoing 
operating expenses. The estimate also includes (1) a one-time cost of $1.0 million for DGS 
to hire a consultant to assess the procurement process for IT projects involving 
modernization and (2) a one-time cost of $1.0 million for DoIT to hire an expert consultant 
to assess State legacy systems.

SB 982/ Page 9 
The fiscal 2025 budget bill as passed by the General Assembly includes a fiscal 2024 
appropriation of $3.0 million in general funds to the Dedicated Purpose Account (DPA) to 
complete an inventory and assessment of State legacy systems and various other IT-related 
projects unrelated to the bill. Thus, it is assumed that a portion of special funds from DPA 
is used to cover the full cost ($1.0 million) of the assessment of State legacy systems 
required by the bill; to the extent the inventory is not completed in fiscal 2025,  
special funds remain available in the out years to complete the inventory. The remainder 
of costs incurred by DoIT and DGS in fiscal 2025 and beyond are assumed to be paid using 
general funds.  
 
Future year expenditures reflect full salaries with annual increases and employee turnover 
as well as annual increases in ongoing operating expenses. The estimate also includes 
$200,000 every other year, beginning in fiscal 2026, in expert consultant costs for DoIT to 
work with each State agency to complete the modernization reports due every other year 
beginning January 1, 2026. 
 
Other State Agencies 
 
State agencies may benefit from the expedited project process established by the bill to 
replace legacy systems with new and upgraded IT systems under the bill. For example, 
affected State agencies may, among other things, experience administrative efficiencies, 
improve customer service, and require fewer staff for certain duties to the extent those 
duties can be automated with modernized systems. However, any such impact cannot be 
reliably estimated without actual experience under the bill.
