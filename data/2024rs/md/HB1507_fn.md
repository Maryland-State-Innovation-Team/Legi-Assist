Transportation - Major Change in Bus Service - Publication on Website 
 
 
This bill modifies the requirements of Chapters 583 and 584 of 2023 by (1) expanding the

before it holds a public hearing on a proposed major service change and (2) requiring MTA

proposed service change.

Transit Equity Analyses and Related Requirements 
 
Chapters 583 and 584 require the Maryland Department of Transportation, beginning 
July 1, 2024, and in collaboration with MTA, to conduct two transit equity analyses, 
perform a cost-benefit analysis, consult with members and leaders of affected communities, 
and take specified actions based on the results of these activities before announcing (1) any 
service change that would constitute a major service change under specified federal

guidelines or (2) any reduction or cancellation of a capital expansion project in the 
construction program of the Consolidated Transportation Program that exceeds transit 
equity thresholds developed by MTA. 
 
Under current law, before holding a public hearing on a proposed service change, MTA 
must publish on its website, for the routes or lines impacted by the service change, an 
evaluation on the demographics of the riders of the routes or lines and the service area. 
The bill instead requires MTA, before holding a public hearing on a proposed service 
change, to publish on its website with a visible link identifying the proposed service change 
on the primary page, for the routes, lines, or any corresponding paratransit service area 
impacted by the service change:   
 
 
a description of (1) the demographics of the riders on the affected route, line, or 
paratransit service area and the affected service area; (2) the schools in the affected 
service area; (3) the types of businesses in the affected service area; (4) the monthly 
ridership for the route, line, or service area; and (5) the effect the proposed service 
change would have on the commutes of riders on the route, line, or service area, the 
corresponding paratransit service area, and the estimated number of paratransit 
riders impacted; 
 
a summary of any publicly available minutes, records, or documents related to the 
proposed service change; and 
 
a brief statement explaining the reason for the proposed service change. 
 
Under current law, after completing the public hearings, MTA must publish the 
transportation equity analysis and cost-benefit analysis on its website and compile a report 
on the impacts of the proposed service change. The report must include the various analyses 
conducted, a community outreach report, any alternatives analyzed, and, if applicable, the 
final alternative selected with any substantial justification statements. The report must be 
(1) made available to the public on MTA’s website, with a visible link from the primary 
information page relating to the proposed service change, and (2) distributed to the 
members of the Board of Public Works, the Attorney General, the Secretary of 
Transportation, any elected officials whose districts would be impacted by the proposed 
service change, any community leaders consulted during the community outreach process, 
the Presiding Officers, and specified legislative committees. Under the bill, the report must 
also be distributed to each member of the General Assembly whose district would be 
impacted by the proposed service change. 
 
Required Public Hearings for Proposed Fare and Service Changes 
 
Generally, pursuant to current law, MTA must hold a public hearing before it:  
 
 
fixes or revises any fare or rate charged to the general public;

 
establishes or abandons any bus or rail route listed on a published timetable; 
 
changes a bus or rail route alignment listed on a published timetable, unless the 
change is needed because of temporary construction or changes in the road network; 
 
reduces the frequency, number of days, or days of service for a commuter bus or 
commuter rail route without substituting a comparable level of service, except under 
specified circumstances; or 
 
establishes or abandons a rail transit station. 
 
Statute specifies that MTA may only implement any such change during the time period 
that begins six weeks after the public hearing and ends six months after the hearing. If 
MTA gives inadequate or defective notice of a public hearing or change, MTA may not 
implement the change unless it makes a reasonable effort to correct the inadequacy or 
defect and a legally sufficient public hearing is held.
