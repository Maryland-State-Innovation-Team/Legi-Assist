Education - Initial Teacher Certification - Requirements 
 
 
This bill repeals the requirement that a teacher preparation program include passing a 
nationally recognized portfolio-based assessment of teaching ability as a requirement for 
graduation beginning July 1, 2025. Further, the bill changes (1) the requirements to qualify 
for an initial teaching certificate beginning July 1, 2025, and (2) the certification 
requirements for a teacher who holds a professional license or certificate from another 
state. The bill also authorizes local school systems to establish rigorous comprehensive 
induction programs as part of a pathway to a teaching certificate. The bill takes effect 
July 1, 2024. 
   
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Public four-year institutions of higher education higher education revenues 
and expenditures are likely not materially affected, as explained below. MSDE and the 
Professional Standards in Teacher Education Board can update teacher licensure 
regulations using existing resources. The Maryland State Department of Education 
(MSDE) and the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) can receive induction 
program plans using existing resources; however, to the extent that plans must be reviewed 
or approved, additional staff may be necessary. No material effect on revenues. 
  
Local Effect:  Local school system expenditures likely increase to implement rigorous 
comprehensive induction programs. Further, the pool of teaching applicants may be larger. 
Revenues are not affected.  
  
Small Business Effect:  None.

Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  Beginning July 1, 2025, for initial teacher certification, graduates from 
approved or alternative teacher preparation programs must: 
 
 
meet one of the following criteria:  (1) pass a nationally recognized, portfolio-based 
assessment of teaching ability; or (2) complete a local school system's rigorous 
teacher induction program, lasting either three years or the duration a teacher can 
hold a conditional certificate, whichever is less; and 
 
meet one additional qualification from the following:  (1) pass a basic literacy skills 
assessment approved by MSDE; (2) hold a degree from a regionally accredited 
institution with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 or its equivalent; or (3) provide 
satisfactory documentation of effective evaluations from a local school system for 
three years. 
 
In addition, an individual must (under current law) pass a subject specific exam and meet 
any other requirements set by the State Board of Education (SBE). 
 
The bill also adds completion of a comprehensive induction program as an alternative 
pathway to certification for a teacher who graduates from an institution of higher education 
in another state or who holds a professional license or certificate from another state.  
 
Local school systems, individually or together, may develop rigorous comprehensive 
induction programs. Before establishing a comprehensive induction program, one or more 
local school systems must submit a plan for the program to MSDE and AIB. A program 
must include a portfolio component that aligns with the Interstate Teacher Assessment and 
Support Consortium standards. This component can count towards teacher preparation 
program coursework requirements. Completing a program exempts candidates from 
needing to pass a nationally recognized portfolio-based assessment of teaching ability. 
 
The Basic Literacy Skills test and the subject-specified examinations must be sufficiently 
rigorous rather than at least as rigorous as the similar examination administered by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
 
It is the intent of the General Assembly that the process for initial certification of qualified 
teachers and other school personnel educated or credentialed in other states be efficient and 
effective to encourage more teachers and other school personnel to live and work in the 
State.          
 
The bill makes other conforming changes.

Current Law:  
 
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future 
 
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future (Blueprint) legislation (including Chapter 771 of 
2019, Chapters 36 and 55 of 2021, and Chapter 33 of 2022) established new programs, 
updated education funding formulas, and, among other provisions established requirements 
for teacher preparation programs and teacher certification.  
 
Teacher Preparation Programs 
 
A teacher preparation program is required to include specific instructional components 
such as basic research skills, differentiation of instruction, cultural competence, restorative 
approaches for student behaviors, identification and remediation of learning deficits, 
utilization of instructional materials including technology, core academic subjects, 
addressing social and emotional needs of students, classroom management, and training 
for virtual learning environments. 
 
Additionally, the program must ensure that participants demonstrate competency in each 
of these components and provide training in understanding and teaching the Maryland 
curriculum frameworks. By July 1, 2025, a program must require a student to pass a 
nationally recognized, portfolio-based assessment of teaching ability to graduate.  
 
Comprehensive Induction Programs 
 
MSDE must develop guidelines for the establishment of comprehensive induction program 
for new teachers. MSDE must consult with local school systems and the Maryland 
Education Deans and Directors Council. 
 
The guidelines must include provision concerning mentoring and professional 
development training and support and incorporate the framework of the Teacher Induction, 
Retention, and Advancement Pilot Program. 
 
A mentor teacher for a teacher in an induction program must be a highly competent teacher 
selected by the local school system who will work to instill in the teacher the skills and 
knowledge for the next generation of teachers. After the career ladder system is well 
established, mentor teachers will be selected using criteria from the career ladder system. 
 
Basic Literacy Skills Test 
 
MSDE must evaluate the rigor of the Basic Literacy Skills test required for initial teacher 
certification. If found inadequate compared to the Massachusetts examination, MSDE must 

END OF PAGE 3

START OF PAGE 4
    
HB 945/ Page 4 
create a new literacy examination of sufficient rigor. Individuals may take this literacy 
examination multiple times without limitation. 
 
After implementing the literacy examination, MSDE must develop and administer 
challenging, subject-specific examinations tailored to the subjects and grade levels teachers 
will teach. These examinations must be as rigorous as those in Massachusetts, and 
individuals can take them multiple times without limitation. Before administering a 
subject-specific examination, MSDE must establish standards for it and provide them to 
approved teacher preparation programs at least a year in advance. Programs must then 
incorporate these standards into their curriculum in a timely manner. 
 
Initial Certification  
 
These requirements pertain to individuals who have completed a teacher preparation 
program approved by MSDE or an alternative program. Beginning July 1, 2025, to qualify 
for an initial certificate, an individual must (1) pass a nationally recognized, portfolio-based 
assessment of teaching ability; (2) pass a rigorous State-specific examination focused on 
reading instruction and content for their teaching grade level; and (3) fulfill any other SBE 
requirements. An individual who previously passed a portfolio-based assessment as a 
graduation requirement is exempt from retaking the assessment. 
 
Additionally, teachers graduating from out-of-state institutions or holding licenses from 
other states must either pass a teaching ability examination within 18 months of local 
school system employment or hold an active National Board Certification (under the bill, 
they may complete a rigorous induction program as an alternative pathway). 
 
MSDE must review and assess the effectiveness of the teaching skill assessments required 
for initial teacher certification. If revisions are needed, MSDE must submit a report to the 
General Assembly outlining recommendations for changing initial teacher licensure 
qualifications. 
 
MSDE is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the impact of new teacher standards 
and assessments on the diversity of teacher candidates. Results of this assessment must be 
reported to AIB. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  
 
Higher Education 
 
Effective July 1, 2025, under current law, teacher candidates in Maryland must submit one 
of two nationally recognized portfolio-based assessments – either the Educative Teacher 
Performance Assessment or the Praxis Performance Assessment for Teachers – in order to 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 945/ Page 5 
qualify for teaching positions. Both assessments entail a $300 fee and are currently required 
by current legislation for graduation from teacher preparation programs in the State as of 
the same date. To the extent that institutions of higher education in the State were expecting 
to cover the cost of the portfolio assessments for their graduates, their expenditures are less 
under the bill. However, any such effect is likely minimal.  
 
In addition, in response to the bill, Frostburg State University, Towson University, 
University of Maryland, College Park Campus, and the Universities at Shady Grove all 
expressed concern that removing the nationally recognized portfolio-based assessment as 
a graduation requirement could lead to a significant decline in enrollment in Maryland’s 
teacher preparation programs. This concern arises from the possibility of out-of-state 
students opting for institutions where passing scores can be easily transferred back to their 
home states. However, the Department of Legislative Services notes that individuals 
unaffiliated with an institution can still take these assessments independently. Moreover, 
the greater flexibility for initial certification may attract more out-of-state candidates to 
Maryland. Therefore, any potential impact on higher education revenues and expenditures 
is expected to be minimal overall.  
 
Maryland State Department of Education 
 
Before establishing a comprehensive induction plan, a local school system must submit a 
plan for the program to MSDE and AIB. MSDE and AIB can receive the plans as required 
by the bill using existing resources.  
 
However, to the extent that MSDE or AIB must review and approve these plans, additional 
staff may be required. MSDE advises that the requirement to align comprehensive 
induction plans with the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium Standards, 
requires the development of state technical assistance, policies and procedures for 
reviewing submissions, and a rubric to assess the alignment of the submission with the 
standards. MSDE believes this work requires a full-time Educational Specialist II as there 
is currently no position at MSDE dedicated to managing reviews of local induction 
programs.
