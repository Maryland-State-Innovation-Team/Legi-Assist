HB 976/ Page 3 
Current Law:  The Public Local Laws of Somerset County require the county 
commissioners to appropriate funds to organized volunteer fire companies in the county. 
Appropriations made by the county commissioners to volunteer fire companies were last 
changed by Chapters 327 and 328 of 2018, which increased funding for fiscal 2019 through 
2024. The legislation also required that the fiscal 2024 funding levels remain the same for 
each year thereafter, unless changed by subsequent legislation. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  There are eight organized volunteer fire companies in 
Somerset County. The county commissioners have provided funding to volunteer fire 
companies for over 45 years. As shown in Exhibit 1, total county appropriations to 
volunteer fire companies will increase by $7,317 in fiscal 2025 and by $46,154 in 
fiscal 2030 and subsequent years. This represents a 2.0% annual increase in county funding 
for each volunteer fire company.
