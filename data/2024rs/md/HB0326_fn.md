Registers of Wills 
 
In general, the registers of wills in each of the State’s 24 jurisdictions are responsible for 
the administration of estates by admitting wills to probate and issuing letters of 
administration, auditing accounts, and maintaining accurate records of all estate matters. 
The registers also serve as clerks of the orphans’ courts.

Notice of Appointment of the Personal Representative  
 
Section 7-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article specifies that, after the appointment of a 
personal representative of an estate, the register must have a notice of the appointment 
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of appointment once a week 
in three successive weeks (1) announcing the appointment and address of the personal 
representative; (2) indicating that all persons having any objection to the appointment (or 
to the probate of the will of the decedent) must file an objection with the register of wills 
on or before six months from the date of the appointment of the personal representative; 
and (3) notifying creditors of the estate to present their claims, as specified. Also, the 
Maryland Rules require the register of wills to deliver copies of the first publication of 
notice of appointment to all “interested persons” and “creditors” (known or discovered) by 
the personal representative, as specified. 
 
Definitions – Persons, Interested Persons, and Unpaid Claimants 
 
Maryland Rules specify that, a “person” includes any individual, partnership, joint stock 
company, unincorporated association or society, municipal or other corporation, the State, 
its agencies or political subdivisions, any court, or any other governmental entity.  
 
An “interested person” is defined in the statute as (1) a person named as executor in a will; 
(2) a person serving as personal representative after judicial or administrative probate; (3) a 
legatee in being, not fully paid, whether the legatee’s interest is vested or contingent; (4) an 
heir even if the decedent dies testate, except that an heir of a testate decedent ceases to be 
an interested person when the register has given specified notice; or (5) an heir or legatee 
whose interest is contingent solely on whether some other heir or legatee survives the 
decedent by a stated period if the other heir or legatee has died with that period.  
 
“Unpaid claimant” is not defined in the statute; however, a person who files a claim against 
the estate of a decedent for an amount that is unpaid is referred to as a claimant or a creditor 
under Title 8 of the Estates and Trusts Article.
