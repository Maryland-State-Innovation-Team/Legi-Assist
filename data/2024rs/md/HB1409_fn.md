Analysis 
 
Current Law:  In Maryland, certificated and noncertificated school employees bargain 
separately. In some counties, specific categories of noncertificated professionals are 
included with certificated employees for bargaining purposes. 
 
For example, local employee organizations for certificated school personnel represent 
school nurses in Baltimore County, eligible substitute teachers in Montgomery County, 
home and hospital teachers in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, school social 
workers in Frederick County, and registered nurses in Carroll County. Junior Reserve 
Officer Training Corps instructors bargain with certificated school personnel in Baltimore, 
Calvert, Carroll, Charles, Garrett, Prince George’s, and St. Mary’s counties. In 
Carroll County, supervisory noncertificated employees bargain with certificated school 
personnel.
