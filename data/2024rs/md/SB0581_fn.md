FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
Senate Bill 581 
(Senator Guzzone) 
Budget and Taxation 
Appropriations 
 
Public School Construction Program - Maryland School for the Blind - State and 
Local Cost-Share 
 
 
This bill requires the Interagency Commission on School Construction (IAC) to set the 
State share of eligible school construction costs at 100% for the Maryland School for the 
Blind (MSB) under the Public School Construction Program (PSCP). The bill takes effect 
July 1, 2024.  
   
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Overall State expenditures and revenues are not affected as the total level of 
funding for PSCP is established annually through the capital budget process. IAC and the 
Maryland State Department of Education can implement the bill with existing budgeted 
resources. 
  
Local Effect:  As total PSCP funding for school construction is a fixed amount, to the 
extent that additional PSCP funds are awarded to MSB, fewer funds are available for public 
school construction projects in local school systems. To the extent local school systems 
receive fewer State matching funds for school construction, any local funds otherwise 
reserved for school construction can be redirected to other local capital construction 
projects.  
  
Small Business Effect:  Minimal.

Analysis 
 
Current Law:  
 
Maryland School for the Blind  
 
MSB is a nonprofit organization that provides educational programs to Maryland students 
from birth to age 21 who are blind, severely visually impaired, or visually 
impaired/multi-disabled. MSB is governed by a 25-member board of directors established 
in State law. Subject to confirmation by the Senate, 5 members are appointed jointly by the 
Governor and the State Superintendent with recommendations from the chair of the board. 
The other 20 members are appointed according to the charter and bylaws of MSB. 
 
School Construction Funding and Maryland School for the Blind 
 
For an overview of State support for public school construction, please see the Appendix 
– State Funding for Public School Construction. 
 
MSB is an independent, nonprofit organization. Although it is not administered by a local 
school system, Chapter 144 of 2012 made MSB eligible for PSCP funding from fiscal 2013 
through 2028 and Chapters 639 and 640 of 2023 extended MSB’s eligibility beyond 
fiscal 2028. The State currently funds 89% of eligible costs for MSB’s school construction 
projects. From fiscal 2013 through 2024, IAC has approved funding for MSB construction 
projects totaling approximately $98.7 million. MSB is subject to the same application and 
approval process as local school systems that apply for PSCP funding.

School Construction Review and Approval Process 
 
The Interagency Commission on School Construction (IAC) manages State review and 
approval of local school construction projects. Each year, local systems develop and submit 
to IAC a facilities master plan that includes an analysis of future school facility needs based 
on the current condition of school buildings and projected enrollment. The master plan 
must be approved by the local school board. Subsequently, each local school system 
submits a capital improvement plan to IAC that includes projects for which it seeks 
planning and/or funding approval for the upcoming fiscal year, which may include projects 
that the local system has forward funded. In addition to approval from the local school 
board, the request for the upcoming fiscal year must be approved by the county’s governing 
body. Typically, the submission letter to IAC contains signatures of both the school board 
president and either the county executive and county council president or chair of the board 
of county commissioners. 
 
Based on its assessment of the relative merit of all the project proposals it receives, and 
subject to the projected level of school construction funds available, IAC determines which 
projects to fund through the Public School Construction Program (PSCP). By December 31 
of each year, IAC must approve projects comprising 75% of the preliminary school 
construction allocation projected to be available by the Governor for the upcoming 
fiscal year. Local school systems may appeal these preliminary decisions by IAC. By 
March 1 of each year, IAC must recommend to the General Assembly projects comprising 
90% of the allocation for school construction submitted in the Governor’s capital budget. 
Following the legislative session, IAC approves projects comprising the remaining school 
construction funds included in the enacted capital budget, no earlier than May 1. The final 
allocations are not subject to appeal. 
 
Built to Learn Act 
 
The Built to Learn Act was enacted as Chapter 20 of 2020, but it was contingent on the 
enactment of House Bill 1300 of 2020 (Blueprint for Maryland’s Future – Implementation). 
As House Bill 1300 was vetoed by the Governor, the Built to Learn Act took effect in 
January 2021 when the General Assembly voted to override the Governor’s veto of 
House Bill 1300. 
 
The Built to Learn Act authorizes the Maryland Stadium Authority (MSA) to issue up to 
$2.2 billion in revenue bonds, backed by annual payments from the Education Trust Fund 
beginning in fiscal 2022, for public school construction projects in the State, including to

support a public-private partnership agreement to build six new schools in Prince George’s 
County. Proceeds from the revenue bonds are in addition to funding available from PSCP 
and are allocated among local school systems as shown in Exhibit 1 (based on MSA’s 
most recent projection of anticipated revenues of $1.7 billion given increases in interest 
rates since the program’s enactment). Funds must be used to build or renovate schools 
within 10 years.

The Built to Learn Act also (1) extends mandated funding for the Healthy School Facility 
Fund (HSFF) by three years, through fiscal 2024, with at least $30.0 million in fiscal 2022 
and at least $40.0 million in each of fiscal 2023 and 2024; (2) raises the mandated annual 
funding level for the Enrollment Growth or Relocatable Classrooms (EGRC) program from 
$40.0 million to $80.0 million beginning in fiscal 2027; and (3) creates the Public School 
Facilities Priority Fund to provide State funds to address the facility needs of the highest 
priority schools identified by the statewide facilities assessment completed by IAC. In 
fiscal 2025 and 2026, the Governor must appropriate at least $40.0 million to the fund. 
Beginning in fiscal 2027, the mandated annual appropriation increases to at least 
$80.0 million. Although mandated funding levels for fiscal 2022 were not required due to

SB 581/ Page 6 
the delay in Chapter 20 taking effect, the fiscal 2022 capital budget, as enacted, included the 
funding (with EGRC receiving a total of $60.0 million and HSFF receiving a total of 
$70.0 million, including $40.0 million in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan). 
 
Prior to distributing funds under the program, MSA must enter into a program 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with IAC (which is in place), and each county, 
local school board, and MSA must enter into a project MOU for each project seeking 
funding from the program. All projects receiving Built to Learn funds must be approved 
by IAC using the same process it uses for PSCP. As of November 2023, IAC has approved 
37 projects and committed more than $1.0 billion in funding to those projects. 
 
Eligible School Construction Costs 
 
IAC establishes a range of appropriate per-student, square-foot allocations for elementary, 
middle, and high schools as well as for special education students, career and technology 
students, and specialized programs. IAC updated the space allocations in 2019 and 
renamed them gross area baselines. IAC also establishes, on an annual basis, a cost 
per square foot that is applicable to major school construction projects. For fiscal 2025, the 
cost per square foot is $404 for new construction without site development (up from $385 
in fiscal 2024) and $481 for new construction with site development (up from $458 in 
fiscal 2024). In general, multiplying the cost per square foot by the applicable gross area 
baseline for each proposed project (based primarily on the State-rated capacity of a 
building) yields the maximum allowable cost that is subject to the State/local cost-share 
formula. Thus, any portion of a project that exceeds the gross area baseline is not eligible 
for State funding and must be paid for by the local school system. 
 
The cost of acquiring land may not be considered an eligible construction cost and may not 
be paid by the State. Otherwise, regulations specify public school construction-related costs 
that are eligible and ineligible for State funding. Chapter 20 expands the costs eligible for 
State funding. In general, the following costs are now included among eligible expenses: 
 
 
planning and design costs (including architectural and engineering fees); 
 
construction of a new facility, a renovation of a new facility, an addition to an 
existing facility, or a replacement of an existing building or building portion 
(i.e., “bricks and mortar”); 
 
building and site development; 
 
replacement of building systems, including roofs; windows; and heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning (i.e., “systemic renovations”;  
 
modular construction that meets specified standards; 
 
 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
SB 581/ Page 7 
 
State-owned relocatable facilities and temporary facilities that are required to be on 
site during construction; and 
 
furniture, fixtures, and equipment with a median useful life of at least 15 years. 
 
Among the major items explicitly not eligible for State funding under current law (besides 
site acquisition) are (1) master plans and feasibility studies; (2) projects or systemic 
renovations for buildings and systems that have been replaced, upgraded, or renovated 
within the last 15 years; and (3) items that do not have a useful life of at least 15 years. 
 
State Share of Eligible Costs 
 
The State pays at least 50% of eligible costs of school construction and renovation projects, 
based on a funding formula that takes into account numerous factors, including each local 
school system’s wealth and ability to pay. The 21st Century School Facilities Act requires 
that the cost-share formula be recalculated every two years (previously, statute required 
recalculation every three years). Exhibit 2 shows the State share of eligible school 
construction costs for all Maryland jurisdictions for fiscal 2023 and 2024; fiscal 2025; and 
fiscal 2026, as approved by IAC. Counties whose calculated State share would have been 
lower in fiscal 2023 than in fiscal 2022 were held harmless by Chapter 698 of 2021; 
Garrett County’s State share was adjusted in accordance with provisions of Chapter 698.

State Funding Levels 
 
Chapter 14 of 2018, the 21st Century School Facilities Act, established the State’s intent 
to provide at least $400.0 million annually, within current debt affordability guidelines. 
The State surpassed the $400.0 million threshold in fiscal 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 
2024; the State would have surpassed $400.0 million in fiscal 2020, but the $10.0 million 
allocation for the School Safety Grant Program (SSGP) was canceled by the Board of 
Public Works for cost containment reasons. Chapter 679 of 2023 repeals both SSGP and 
the Aging Schools Program beginning in fiscal 2027 with the intent that funding for those 
programs be transferred to the Priority Fund, which takes effect that year. Exhibit 3 shows 
annual State public school construction funding from fiscal 2020 through 2024, by county. 
 
The fiscal 2025 operating and capital budgets, as passed by the General Assembly, provide 
more than $900 million in funding for public school construction projects in the State, 
divided among general obligation (GO) bond funding, revenue bonds, special funds, and a 
limited amount of general funds. The total includes: 
 
 
$425.4 million in MSA revenue bonds for Built to Learn; 
 
$313.9 million in GO bonds for PSCP; 
 
$40.0 million in GO bonds for EGRC; 
 
$90.0 million in GO bonds for HSFF;  
 
$6.1 million in GO bonds for the Aging Schools Program; and  
 
$29.0 million in special and general funds for public-private partnerships for school 
construction in Prince George’s County under Built to Learn.
