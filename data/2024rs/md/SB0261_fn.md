State Board of Barbers - Sunset Extension and Report 
 
 
This bill extends the termination date for the State Board of Barbers within the Maryland 
Department of Labor (MDL) by three years to July 1, 2027, subject to the evaluation and 
reestablishment provisions of the Maryland Program Evaluation Act (MPEA). It also 
requires MDL to submit a report to the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee (JAEC) by 
July 1, 2025, with information – regarding the State Board of Barbers – to be determined 
by JAEC. The bill takes effect June 1, 2024. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Special fund revenues and expenditures for the board are maintained through 
FY 2027. MDL can likely prepare the required report with existing budgeted resources. 
  
Local Effect:  None. 
 
Small Business Effect:  MDL has determined that this bill has minimal or no impact on 
small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) concurs with this 
assessment. (The attached assessment does not reflect amendments to the bill.) 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law/Background:  The State Board of Barbers issues barber and barber-stylist 
(limited) licenses. The barber license encompasses the full scope of barbering, while the 
barber-stylist license applies solely to the hair portion of barbering. The board also registers 
apprentices and conducts health and safety inspections of barber shops. Applicants for 
licensure must pass a written and a practical exam and meet specified experience

(apprenticeship) or education (specified hours of instruction at an approved barber school) 
requirements. 
 
Effective July 1, 2018, Chapter 256 of 2017 established the State Barbers and 
Cosmetologists Boards’ Fund and redirected licensing revenue associated with both boards 
from the general fund to the new special fund. The Act also repealed statutory fees and 
instead authorized the boards to set fees by regulation. 
 
Maryland Program Evaluation Act 
 
The board is 1 of approximately 60 regulatory entities and activities subject to termination 
unless reauthorized periodically through statute. Under MPEA, these entities may also be 
subject to an evaluation by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability (OPEGA) within DLS prior to their termination. However, OPEGA may 
conduct an evaluation only if directed by specified entities or by legislation. The board is 
scheduled to terminate July 1, 2024; OPEGA was not asked to conduct an evaluation prior 
to its termination. Accordingly, the board has requested reauthorizing legislation. 
 
Additional Comments:  Absent reauthorization of the board during the 2024 legislative 
session, regulation of the practice of barbering in Maryland ceases July 1, 2024. 
 
 
Additional Information 
 
Recent Prior Introductions:  Similar legislation has not been introduced within the last 
three years.
