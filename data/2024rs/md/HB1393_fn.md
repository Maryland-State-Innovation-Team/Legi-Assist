Department of Legislative Services 
Maryland General Assembly 
2024 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 1393 
(Delegate Crosby) 
Economic Matters 
Education, Energy, and the Environment 
 
Electric System Planning - Scope and Funding 
 
 
This bill modifies provisions related to electric distribution system planning established in 
the Climate Solutions Now Act (CSNA) of 2022 by (1) broadening the scope of the State 
policy goals beyond the electric distribution system and making conforming changes; 
(2) broadening references to federal funds available for electric companies to meet the 
State’s policy goals, including references in related labor requirements; and (3) delaying 
and modifying a related requirement for the Public Service Commission (PSC) to adopt 
regulations or issue orders for electric distribution system planning, subject to specified 
considerations. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  PSC and the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) can handle the bill’s 
requirements with existing budgeted resources. The bill does not otherwise materially 
affect State finances or operations. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill does not materially affect local government finances or operations. 
 
Small Business Effect:  Potential meaningful. The bill may alter the funding amounts, 
timing, or allocation for specific utility projects, which may affect small businesses 
involved in such projects. 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:  PSC is required, rather than authorized, to adopt regulations or orders that 
require electric companies to apply for federal and other available funds in a timely manner. 
The regulations or orders must also ensure that least-cost debt is used. PSC must also

HB 1393/ Page 2 
require each electric company to report at least quarterly to PSC and MEA on information 
related to the use of federal funds. 
 
The date by which PSC must adopt regulations or issue orders to implement specific 
policies for electric distribution system planning and improvements in order to promote 
specified policy goals in CSNA is delayed from July 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025. The 
regulations or orders must also require consideration of investment in, or procurement of, 
cost-effective demand-side methods and technology to improve reliability and efficiency, 
including virtual power plants. The regulations and orders must be developed with 
consideration given to the inherent differences, individual circumstances, and available 
resources among different types of electric companies and, if determined necessary by 
PSC, establish separate requirements for each type. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Climate Solutions Now Act 
 
CSNA made broad changes to the State’s approach to reducing statewide greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions and addressing climate change. Among other things, the Act accelerated 
previous statewide GHG emissions reductions targets originally established under the 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act by requiring the State to develop plans, adopt 
regulations, and implement programs to (1) reduce GHG emissions by 60% from 
2006 levels by 2031 and (2) achieve net-zero statewide GHG emissions by 2045. 
 
Provisions modified by the bill are described below – note the references to the electric 
distribution system. 
 
 
Statement of Policy Goals 
 
CSNA established the goal of the State that the electric distribution system support, in a 
cost-effective manner, the State’s policy goals with regard to (1) GHG reduction; 
(2) renewable energy; (3) decreasing dependence on electricity imported from other states; 
and (4) achieving energy distribution resiliency, efficiency, and reliability. 
 
 
Electric Distribution System Planning and Improvements 
 
By December 1, 2024, and each year thereafter, PSC must submit a report to the 
General Assembly with information regarding the current status of electric distribution 
system evolution, including information on electric distribution system planning processes 
and implementation that promote, as specific goals, the following:

HB 1393/ Page 3 
 
measures to decrease GHG emissions incident to electric distribution, including 
high levels of distributed energy resources and electric vehicles; 
 
giving priority to vulnerable communities in the development of distributed energy 
resources and electric vehicle infrastructure; 
 
energy efficiency; 
 
meeting anticipated increases in load; 
 
incorporation of energy storage technology to support the electric distribution 
system, as specified; 
 
efficient management of load variability; 
 
electric distribution system resiliency and reliability; 
 
bidirectional power flows; 
 
demand response and other nonwire and noncapital alternatives; 
 
increased use of distributed energy resources, including electric vehicles; 
 
transparent stakeholder participation in ongoing electric distribution system 
planning processes; and 
 
any other issues PSC considers appropriate. 
 
By July 1, 2025, PSC must adopt regulations or issue orders to implement specific policies 
for electric distribution system planning and improvements in order to promote the policy 
goals described above. PSC is not required to give consideration to the three different types 
of electric companies in the State (investor-owned electric companies, municipal electric 
utilities, and electric cooperatives) or to establish separate requirements for each type. 
 
CSNA also required PSC to conduct a one-time study to assess the capacity of the 
distribution systems of the larger electric and gas companies to successfully serve 
customers under a managed transition to a highly electrified building sector, which can be 
viewed on the PSC website. 
 
 
Use of Federal Funds 
 
CSNA states that the General Assembly strongly encourages the State’s electric companies 
to pursue diligently federal funds to meet the State’s policy goals for the electric 
distribution system, including funds made available under specified provisions of the 
federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
 
PSC and MEA must provide assistance and support to electric companies for applying for 
and obtaining access to federal and other available funds to meet the State’s policy goals 
for the electric distribution system. MEA must identify funding sources that may be 
available to electric companies to implement the State’s policy goals, including funding 
for (1) increasing the efficiency of electric distribution systems, including through

HB 1393/ Page 4 
installation and integration of energy storage devices and operational changes and 
upgrades; (2) grid-hardening activities to reduce the occurrence of or consequences of 
events that disrupt operations of the electric distribution system due to extreme weather or 
natural disasters; (3) other distribution system-related upgrade activities available for 
funding under specified provisions of the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; 
and (4) other specific activities that PSC identifies. 
 
As needed to promote the State’s goals for the electric distribution system, PSC must 
require each electric company to report to PSC and MEA on (1) the funding for which the 
electric company has applied; (2) the purposes for which the funding is intended to be used; 
(3) the status of the funding applications; and (4) conditions that must be met to obtain the 
funding. PSC may also adopt regulations or issue orders that require electric companies to 
apply for federal and other available funds in a timely manner. 
 
 
Wage and Labor Requirements for Specified Electric Infrastructure Work 
 
An investor-owned electric company or gas and electric company must require a contractor 
or subcontractor that is working on specified projects (described below) to (1) pay the area 
prevailing wage for each trade employed, including wages and fringe benefits; (2) offer 
health care and retirement benefits to the employees working on the project; (3) participate 
in an apprenticeship program registered with the State for each trade employed on the 
project; (4) establish and execute a plan for outreach, recruitment, and retention of State 
residents, as specified, to perform work on the project; (5) have been in compliance with 
federal and State wage and hour laws for the previous three years; (6) be subject to all State 
reporting and compliance requirements; and (7) maintain all appropriate licenses in good 
standing. 
 
These wage and labor requirements apply to a project that (1) involves the construction, 
reconstruction, installation, demolition, restoration, or alteration of any electric 
infrastructure of the company (and any related traffic control activities) and (2) is funded 
by federal funds to meet the State’s policy goals for the electric distribution system, as 
specified. The wage and labor requirements only apply to the portion of a project supported 
by the federal funds. 
 
Additional Comments:  Although not modified by the bill, § 1-205 of the Environment 
Article, as enacted by CSNA, requires the Maryland Department of the Environment, in 
coordination with PSC and MEA, to coordinate with utility providers in the State to apply 
for and access federal funds in order to meet the policy goals of the State for the electric 
distribution grid system.
