This departmental bill provides for the transfer of ownership and operation of thoroughbred 
racing facilities in the State from the Maryland Jockey Club (MJC) to the Maryland 
Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority (MTROA). The bill also alters provisions of 
the Racing and Community Development Act of 2020 (Chapter 590) as well as 
Chapter 111 of 2023, which established MTROA, and makes additional funding available 
to MTROA. The bill takes effect June 1, 2024. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  Bonds totaling $400.0 million are issued in FY 2025 (with proceeds 
deposited in a special fund for expenditure, not shown). Special fund revenues increase by 
$4.8 million and $10.0 million in FY 2024 and 2025, respectively, from transfers; another 
$3.6 million annually, beginning in FY 2025, from redistribution of specified revenues; 
and $4.5 million in FY 2026 from mandated funding. Special fund expenditures increase 
by $2.0 million and $14.8 million in FY 2024 and 2025, respectively, reflecting MTROA 
use of available funding; $3.0 million annually beginning in FY 2025 for Prince George’s 
County; $4.5 million in FY 2026, if mandated funding is expended; and $24.0 million 
annually from FY 2026 through 2055 for debt service payments. General fund expenditures 
increase by $10.7 million in FY 2026 for two mandated appropriations. General fund 
revenues decrease by $3.6 million annually, beginning in FY 2025, due to redistributions; 
general fund and special fund revenues also decrease from multiple tax provisions (not 
quantified) beginning in FY 2025 or 2026 as relevant. This bill establishes mandated 
distributions beginning in FY 2025 and mandated appropriations for FY 2026 only.

HB 1524/ Page 2 
Local Effect:  Baltimore City property, recordation, and transfer tax revenues decrease 
beginning with the redevelopment of the Pimlico site. Baltimore City expenditures are not 
directly affected. Prince George’s County revenues increase by $3.0 million annually 
beginning in FY 2025 and by an additional $6.2 million in FY 2026 only. Expenditures for 
the City of Bowie may be delayed by one year as noted below. 
 
Small Business Effect:  MTROA has determined that this bill has a meaningful impact on 
small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services concurs with this 
assessment. (The attached assessment does not reflect amendments to the bill.)

HB 1524/ Page 3 
The bill also alters provisions of Chapter 590 that provided for the redevelopment of the 
Pimlico and Laurel Park racing facilities and for the conveyance of the Bowie Race Course 
Training Center. Chapter 590 also provided for bond issuances, funding mechanisms and 
fund transfers, the ownership and management of racing facilities, and tax incentives.  
 
The bill makes the following changes and alterations to Chapter 590:   
 
 
authorizes the Maryland Racing Commission to issue a license to and award 
racing days to a nonprofit organization that leases or subleases a racing facility from 
MTROA; 
 
authorizes the transfer of the Preakness Stakes to another track in the State during 
the reconstruction of Pimlico Race Course, subject to the approval of MTROA; 
 
increases, from $375.0 million to $400.0 million, the amount of bonds that may be 
issued to finance planning, design, and construction, and related expenses for 
construction management, professional fees, and contingencies in connection with 
racing facilities, on behalf of MTROA; 
 
specifies that the financing plan or plans must provide for at least $250.0 million in 
anticipated project costs at the Pimlico site and $110.0 million in anticipated project 
costs at the training facility site; furthermore, the plan must also include a joint plan 
between MTROA and the Department of Housing and Community Development 
(DHCD) that includes specified investments in and around the Pimlico racing 
facility site;

specifies that at least $17.0 million must be transferred each year from the State 
Lottery Fund to the Racing and Community Development Financing Fund 
(Financing Fund) (current law requires a $17.0 million annual transfer); 
 
specifies that various existing tax incentives apply to the Pimlico site or training 
facility site and maintains specified tax incentives related to the transfer of the 
Bowie Race Course Training Center; 
 
requires sales and use taxes collected from the sale of specified claiming horses to 
be distributed to the Racing and Community Development Facilities Fund 
(Facilities Fund);  
 
delays the conveyance of the Bowie Race Course Training Center to the 
City of Bowie until December 31, 2025; and  
 
specifies that $2.0 million of the funds transferred to the Facilities Fund may be 
used (1) before June 1, 2024, to reimburse the racing licensees’ costs attributable to 
maintaining ongoing year-round racing operations, ensuring the continued running 
of the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico racing facility site during construction, and 
expenses related to the Bowie Race Course Training Center before the conveyance 
of the property and (2) on or after June 1, 2024, by MTROA for transitional, 
operational, and capital costs at Laurel Park and other uses deemed necessary by the 
authority.

HB 1524/ Page 4 
The bill also:   
 
 
requires that, by June 30, 2024, the unencumbered fund balance, including accrued 
interest, that is allocated to Rosecroft Raceway under the Racetrack Facilities 
Renewal Account (RFRA) be transferred to the Facilities Fund. The transferred 
funds may be used by MTROA for transitional, operational, and capital costs at 
Laurel Park and other uses deemed necessary by the authority;  
 
requires the Governor to include in the fiscal 2026 budget bill an appropriation of  
$4.5 million to RFRA to be made available for Rosecroft Raceway. If 
Rosecroft Raceway closes, the unencumbered fund balance of the amount available 
to Rosecroft Raceway from RFRA must be made available to Ocean Downs 
Race Course;  
 
alters a provision of current law related to the timing of when unencumbered RFRA 
funds will be paid to the Education Trust Fund;  
 
requires the Governor to include in the fiscal 2026 operating or capital budget bill

authorizes the Governor to transfer by budget amendment for fiscal 2025 up to 
$10.0 million from the Financing Fund to the Maryland Racing Operations Fund to 
be used by MTROA or a nonprofit organization designated by MTROA as working 
capital. The bill requires MTROA to transfer or assign specified obligations before 
the authority sunsets at the end of June 2029;  
 
reallocates $10.0 million of fiscal 2022 capital funds from DHCD to the Board of 
Directors of Park Heights Renaissance to be used, in consultation with specified 
entities, for investments in workforce housing;  
 
requires MTROA to prepare accrual basis financial statements, and beginning with 
the first full year of thoroughbred racing operations at the newly constructed Pimlico 
racing facility, distribute 10% of the annual net income of MTROA as local impact 
grants to communities surrounding Pimlico Race Course. For any fiscal year that 
MTROA reports an operating loss, that loss must be offset by a transfer from 
Purse Dedication Account (PDA) proceeds allocated to thoroughbred purses;  
 
requires MTROA to submit a copy of a lease for the Pimlico racing facility site to 
the Legislative Policy Committee for review and comment at least 45 days before 
entering into the lease;  
 
requires the owner of a racetrack, at least 30 days before the owner enters into a

 
adds two members to MTROA; and 
 
extends provisions of Chapter 111 regarding MTROA and the Maryland Racing 
Operations Fund from June 30, 2027, to June 30, 2029. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Racing and Community Redevelopment Act of 2020 
 
Chapter 590 provided for the redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore City and 
Laurel Park in Anne Arundel County, as well as for the conveyance of the Bowie Race 
Course Training Center. 
 
Chapter 590 authorized the Maryland Stadium Authority (MSA), subject to the approval 
of the Board of Public Works, to issue up to $375.0 million in bonds to finance planning, 
design, and construction and related expenses for construction management, professional 
fees, and contingencies in connection with racing facilities. The financing plan or plans 
must provide for at least $180.0 million in anticipated project costs at the Pimlico site and  
$155.0 million in anticipated project costs at the Laurel Park site. Debt issued for the 
redevelopment projects is a limited obligation of MSA and is not an obligation or debt of 
the State. Chapter 590 specified the requirements for and the contents of long-term 
agreements for management and operations at the Pimlico and Laurel Park racing facility 
sites. 
 
Chapter 590 provided for the financing of the racing facility redevelopment projects and 
for the payment of debt service on bonds issued by MSA. The Act established the Financing 
Fund and the Facilities Fund. The Financing Fund is a revolving fund established for 
implementing racing and community development projects and for the payment of debt 
service expenses incurred by MSA, or otherwise approved by MSA, concerning those 
projects; the fund consists of proceeds from the sale of bonds and money paid to the fund 
from the State Lottery Fund. The Facilities Fund is a revolving fund established for 
implementing racing and community development projects and to pay specified expenses 
incurred by MSA; the fund consists of specified monies, fund transfers, and the 
unencumbered fund balances allocated to thoroughbred tracks and Rosecroft Raceway 
under RFRA as of June 30, 2020. 
 
Chapter 590 also required that, by December 31, 2023, the owner of the Bowie Race Course 
Training Center must convey the training center property to the City of Bowie “as is,” with 
all defects that may exist, whether known or unknown, and without any express or implied 
warranty, guarantee by, or recourse against the conveyor of the property. Chapter 590  
specifies permissible uses for certain portions of the transferred property.

HB 1524/ Page 6 
Chapter 61 of 2022 
 
Among various provisions, Chapter 61 of 2022 required MSA to provide two reports, by 
September 30, 2022, and January 1, 2023, to the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, 
the House Appropriations Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee on the 
progress of the Pimlico and Laurel Park racing facility redevelopment plans under 
Chapter 590. In addition, the Act required the Maryland Economic Development 
Corporation (MEDCO) to report, by September 1, 2022, to those committees on an 
evaluation of the feasibility, limitations, costs, and potential benefits related to the 
acquisition of the Laurel Park racing facility site by a government or nonprofit entity to 
ensure the redevelopment and construction of facilities at the Laurel Park site. Finally, the 
Act required the mile thoroughbred licensees, the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen’s 
Association, 
and 
the 
Maryland 
Horse 
Breeders 
Association 
to 
report 
by 
September 30, 2022, to the same committees on the status of the Maryland thoroughbred 
racing operations. 
 
Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority 
 
Chapter 111 established MTROA as a body politic and corporate and an instrumentality of 
the State, with the stated purpose of maintaining the State as a best-in-class thoroughbred 
racing venue. To that end, the authority may:   
 
 
study and make any recommendations that the authority finds are in the best 
interests of thoroughbred racing in the State; 
 
in coordination with other State entities, develop new and existing horse racing and 
training facilities in the State; 
 
take specified actions (as discussed below), but only in accordance with an 
executive order or a determination of the Maryland Racing Commission, and subject 
to specified review and comment, that a thoroughbred racing licensee – for any 
reason other than weather, an act of God, or other circumstances beyond the control 
of the licensee – is unable to support the minimum number of live racing days; 
 
enter into any agreements, leases, partnerships, or contracts necessary to support 
and sustain Maryland thoroughbred racing and pari-mutuel wagering activity and 
ensure compliance with Maryland Racing Commission rules and regulations; 
 
authorize or create a separate body, entity, or holding company to carry out any 
provisions of the Act; 
 
adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act; and 
 
make any other recommendations the authority deems necessary. 
 
Chapter 111 allows for MTROA, under such an order or determination, to manage and 
oversee day-to-day thoroughbred horse racing operations, live racing days, and assets in 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 1524/ Page 7 
the State and, in coordination with MEDCO, acquire property or contractual interests, as 
specified. Under such circumstances, the Maryland Racing Commission may issue a 
license and live racing days to the authority. 
 
Chapter 111 specifies the membership of MTROA and authorizes the hiring of an executive 
director as well as the employment or retention of staff as deemed necessary or advisable. 
 
MTROA may use various powers to operate as necessary, including (1) accepting loans, 
grants, or assistance of any kind from the federal or State government, a local government, 
a college or university, or a private source; (2) entering into contracts and other legal 
instruments; (3) retaining, employing, or hiring an independent firm for the purpose of 
operating and managing live horse racing in the State; (4) creating, owning, controlling, or 
being a member of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or other entity, 
whether operated for profit or not for profit; and (5) assisting with the advertising and 
promotion of horse racing interests. The authority is exempt from State and local taxes. 
 
Chapter 111 also establishes the Maryland Racing Operations Fund as a special, nonlapsing 
fund administered by MTROA to assist in financing the acquisition, construction, 
rehabilitation, or other capital or operating expenses for thoroughbred racetracks in the 
State. The fund consists of (1) money distributed to the fund from the existing Financing 
Fund, as authorized by the Act; (2) money appropriated in the State budget to the fund; 
(3) interest earnings of the fund; and (4) any other money from any other source accepted 
for the benefit of the fund. Any interest earnings of the fund must be credited to the fund 
and expenditures from the fund may be made only in accordance with the State budget. 
 
The owner of the Bowie Race Course Training Center was required to convey the training 
center property to the City of Bowie by December 31, 2023. Chapter 111 delayed that 
conveyance date to December 31, 2024. 
 
The fiscal 2023 capital budget (Chapter 344 of 2022) directed $5.0 million in funding to 
Pimlico Race Course demolition and $10.0 million in funding to the acquisition, planning, 
design, construction, repair, renovation, reconstruction, site improvement, and capital 
equipping of backstretch housing facilities at Laurel Park. Chapter 111 redirected these 
funds to the Maryland Racing Operations Fund for the acquisition, construction, 
rehabilitation, or other capital or operating expenditures for thoroughbred racetracks. 
 
MTROA was required to report to the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, the  
House Appropriations Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee by 
December 1, 2023, on (1) the feasibility of establishing at least two alternative 
thoroughbred training facilities in the State; (2) thoroughbred racing industry models and 
recommendations regarding operating models in the State; and (3) the progress of the 
Pimlico and Laurel Park racing facility redevelopment plans under Chapter 590. A copy of 

END OF PAGE 7

START OF PAGE 8
    
HB 1524/ Page 8 
the report can be found here:  Report of the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating 
Authority. 
 
Background:  In its January 2024 report to the General Assembly, MTROA recommended 
that racing be consolidated at Pimlico in Baltimore City, referred to as the Pimlico Plus 
plan. This plan would also require the development of a training facility. MTROA’s report 
also recommended a public ownership structure for the tracks and subsequent lease of them 
to a nonprofit entity led by Maryland industry professionals. This is similar to the model 
used in New York, which has three racetracks owned by the New York Racing Authority. 
In addition, Del Mar in California, which occasionally hosts the Breeders Cup, is owned 
by the State of California. 
 
State Fiscal Effect:  Chapter 590 provided for the redevelopment of the Laurel and 
Pimlico racing facility sites and for the financing of the redevelopment plans. Although the 
general financing and repayment mechanisms for the bond issuances are largely unchanged 
under the bill, absent the bill, it is unlikely that the current authorization for $375.0 million 
would have been issued. Accordingly, this analysis reflects issuance of the entire 
$400.0 million in bonds, as now authorized, by MSA for the redevelopment of the 
Pimlico and training facility sites – likely in fiscal 2025. MSA advises that if $400.0 million 
in bonds are issued in the spring/summer of 2025, debt service payments would be between 
$24.0 million and $25.0 million annually beginning in fiscal 2026. Assuming that debt 
service payments will be over 30 years and annual debt service payments are approximately 
$24.0 million, payments (principal and interest) total approximately $720.0 million over 
the 30-year period. 
 
Capitalization of Funds and Related Spending 
 
Financing Fund:  Under Chapter 590, when the bonds are issued, the monies are deposited 
in the Financing Fund and used to finance the racing facility projects. This is the same 
under the bill; however, beginning in fiscal 2025, the bill directs at least $17.0 million, 
rather than $17.0 million, from the State Lottery Fund to the Financing Fund for each 
fiscal year until the bonds issued to finance racing facilities are no longer outstanding and 
unpaid. Based on current MSA estimates, $17.0 million annually would not be sufficient 
to cover projected debt service costs under the bill. MSA advises that there is currently 
$52.0 million in the Financing Fund. 
 
The bill authorizes the transfer of $10.0 million, by budget amendment in fiscal 2025, from 
the Financing Fund to the Maryland Racing Operations Fund for use by MTROA. 
Assuming the transfer is made, Maryland Racing Operations Fund revenues and 
expenditures increase correspondingly – for purposes of this analysis, those expenditures 
are assumed to be made in fiscal 2025. 
 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 1524/ Page 9 
Facilities Fund:  Under Chapter 590, the Facilities Fund was primarily capitalized by a 
series of one-time transfers from RFRA and PDA. MSA advises that there is currently 
$33.0 million in the Facilities Fund. 
 
The bill provides additional funding for the Facilities Fund. First, the bill requires that, by 
June 30, 2024, the unencumbered fund balance, including accrued interest, allocated to 
Rosecroft Raceway under RFRA be transferred to the Facilities Fund. The transferred 
funds may be used by MTROA for transitional, operational, and capital costs at Laurel Park 
and other uses deemed necessary by the authority. The Maryland Racing Commission 
estimates this amount is approximately $4.8 million. This analysis assumes those funds 
would not have been expended otherwise, at least not in the near term, and that MTROA 
makes use of that authorization in fiscal 2025; accordingly, special fund expenditures 
increase by $4.8 million in fiscal 2025. Second, the bill requires sales and use taxes 
collected from the sale of specified claiming horses to be distributed to the Facilities Fund. 
These sales tax collections totaled $537,000 in calendar 2022 and $579,000 in 
calendar 2023. Accordingly, approximately $600,000 is assumed to be received as 
Facilities Fund revenues each year beginning in fiscal 2025 (and general fund revenues 
decrease correspondingly). 
 
In addition, $2.0 million of the funds already transferred to the Facilities Fund under 
current law may be used (1) before June 1, 2024, as under current law, to reimburse the 
racing licensees’ costs attributable to maintaining ongoing year-round racing operations, 
ensuring the continued running of the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico site during 
construction, and expenses related to the Bowie Race Course Training Center before the 
conveyance of the property but (2) on or after June 1, 2024, under the bill, only by MTROA 
for transitional, operational, and capital costs at Laurel Park and other uses deemed 
necessary by the authority. Accordingly, MTROA special fund expenditures are assumed 
to increase by $2.0 million in fiscal 2024. 
 
State Lottery Fund:  Chapter 590 generally provided for the annual repayment of funds, 
beginning in fiscal 2022, to the State Lottery Fund as follows:  (1) RFRA funds available 
to thoroughbred racing licensees; (2) $5.0 million from PDA from thoroughbred purses; 
and (3) $3.5 million from local impact grants provided to Baltimore City from video lottery 
terminal (VLT) proceeds. This repayment mechanism remains the same under the bill. The 
State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency advises that the agency received approximately 
$18.9 million in fiscal 2022 and $18.8 million in fiscal 2023 from the three sources. The 
agency reports that the funds received in excess of $17.0 million ($1.9 million in 
fiscal 2022 and $1.8 million in fiscal 2023) were deposited in the general fund. Under the 
bill, funds in excess of $17.0 million would be distributed to the Financing Fund. 
 
However, 1% of VLT revenues is distributed to RFRA for the first 16 years after a video 
lottery facility begins operating, after which time the 1% distribution will go to the 

END OF PAGE 9

START OF PAGE 10
    
HB 1524/ Page 10 
Education Trust Fund. Based on the opening dates of each facility, RFRA revenues will 
begin decreasing in fiscal 2027 as the 16-year distribution requirement ends for the casino 
in Cecil County. Distributions to RFRA from the Prince George’s County casino, the last 
of the six casinos to open, will end in fiscal 2033. Based on current VLT revenue estimates, 
beginning in fiscal 2029, there will be insufficient funds directed to the State Lottery Fund 
to fully pay back the amount that is directed to the Financing Fund. Beginning in 
fiscal 2033, when RFRA funds are no longer available, the State Lottery Fund will only 
receive $8.5 million in total annual funding from PDA and Baltimore City local impact 
grants to partially cover the amount directed to the Financing Fund. The bill does not alter 
this funding distribution. 
 
Required Appropriations, Distributions, and Reallocations 
 
As noted, the bill requires the Governor to include in the fiscal 2026 budget bill an 
appropriation of $4.5 million to RFRA to be made available for Rosecroft Raceway to 
offset the transfer of funds from RFRA to the Facilities Fund. The bill also requires the 
Governor to include in the fiscal 2026 operating or capital budget bill an appropriation of 
$6.2 million to Prince George’s County for site development, demolition, and grading on 
and around the Bowie Race Course Training Center property and Rosecroft Raceway. In 
addition, beginning in fiscal 2025, $3.0 million must be distributed annually from the State 
Lottery Fund to Prince George’s County for supplemental local impact grants. As a result:   
 
 
general fund expenditures increase by $4.5 million in fiscal 2026 due to the 
mandated appropriation for RFRA – special fund revenues and special fund 
expenditures are assumed to increase correspondingly;  
 
PAYGO general fund expenditures increase by $6.2 million in fiscal 2026 due to 
the mandated appropriation to Prince George’s County (alternatively, $6.2 million  
in general obligation (GO) bonds may be used to meet the mandate; if so, spending 
in the capital budget does not increase but other projects may be delayed or funded 
at lower amounts); and  
 
general fund revenues decrease by $3.0 million annually beginning in fiscal 2025 
and State Lottery Fund revenues and expenditures increase correspondingly due to 
the mandated distribution to Prince George’s County for supplemental local impact 
grants.  
 
The bill also reallocates $10.0 million in GO bond funding originally authorized in the 
fiscal 2023 capital budget; although this funding is no longer available for use directly by 
MTROA, there is no net impact on overall spending.

HB 1524/ Page 11 
Tax Revenue Changes 
 
Chapter 590 provided for a variety of tax incentives for the redevelopment of the Laurel 
and Pimlico racing facility sites. These incentives are generally unchanged under the bill, 
but the bill eliminates references to the Laurel site. The bill also redirects sales and use tax 
revenues from the sale of specified claiming horses to the Facilities Fund. As a result, 
general fund and Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund (BMFF) revenues decrease by an 
indeterminate amount annually beginning in fiscal 2025 (based on recent experience, 
however, the total for claiming revenues could approach $600,000 each year). 
 
General fund revenues decrease as a result of the subtraction modification for gains 
recognized due to the transfer or conveyance of the Pimlico site, and the amount of income 
recognized as a result of any expenditure of specified governmental funds. The amount of 
the decrease cannot be reliably estimated. 
 
General fund and BMFF revenues also decrease beginning in fiscal 2025, through 
fiscal 2029, as a result of the sales and use tax exemption for the purchase of specified 
construction materials for use in the construction, furnishing, equipping, or redevelopment 
of the Pimlico and training facility sites. MSA does not have an estimate for construction 
costs that would qualify for the sales and use tax exemption. Although this exemption was 
already in place until January 2026, this analysis assumes that, as for the bond issuance by 
MSA, the exemption could not have been taken absent this bill. Moreover, the bill extends 
it for three years. 
 
Annuity Bond Fund revenues may decrease as a result of the property tax exemption for 
the interests of a person in an improvement made at the Pimlico and training facility sites 
for the duration of specified long-term agreements. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:  Although certain tax benefits exist under current law, the bill likely 
effectuates them; thus, the bill affects property, recordation, and transfer taxes in 
Baltimore City and the jurisdiction where the training facility will be located. 
 
Baltimore City property tax revenues may decrease as a result of the property tax 
exemption for the interests of a person in an improvement made at the Pimlico site for the 
duration of specified long-term agreements. The amount of the decrease cannot be reliably 
estimated and depends on the value of the improvements when the projects are completed. 
 
Baltimore City transfer tax revenues may decrease resulting from the exemption for 
instruments of writing that transfer or grant a security interest in property within the 
Pimlico site if the transfer or grant is by any combination of project entities, MJC Entities, 
Baltimore City, or an entity designated by Baltimore City. The amount of the decrease 
cannot be reliably estimated and depends on the value of the consideration transferred.

HB 1524/ Page 12 
Baltimore City recordation tax revenues may decrease resulting from the exemption for 
instruments of writing that transfer or grant a security interest in property within the 
Pimlico site if the transfer or grant is by any combination of project entities, MJC Entities, 
Baltimore City, or an entity designated by Baltimore City. The amount of the decrease 
cannot be reliably estimated and depends on the value of the consideration transferred. 
 
These same exemptions and resulting revenue decreases will apply to the jurisdiction 
where the training facility site is ultimately located. 
 
Prince George’s County revenues increase by $3.0 million annually beginning in 
fiscal 2025 from the mandated distribution for supplemental local impact grants and by an 
additional $6.2 million in fiscal 2026 due to the mandated one-time appropriation. 
 
Further, the bill extends the deadline for the required conveyance of the Bowie Race Course 
Training Center to the City of Bowie by one year, which delays expenditures for the city.
