Agreements 
 
 
This departmental bill authorizes the disclosure of tax information to a person, 
governmental entity, or tax compliance organization for the purpose of assisting the 
Comptroller in tax compliance activity and requires specified parties to whom confidential 
tax information is to be disclosed to enter into a binding written data use agreement. An 
officer, employee, former officer, or former employee of a person, governmental entity, or 
tax compliance organization to which tax information has been disclosed in accordance 
with the bill’s authorization may not disclose, in any manner, any tax information obtained 
in accordance with the data use agreement, unless the disclosure is authorized expressly by 
State or federal law, authorized by the data use agreement, or required by a court order. 
Consistent with existing law, an officer, employee, former officer, or former employee of 
a person, governmental entity, or tax compliance organization to which tax information has 
been disclosed who makes a disclosure in violation of State law is guilty of a misdemeanor 
subject to a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. The bill takes 
effect July 1, 2024.

Small Business Effect:  The Office of the Comptroller has determined that this bill has 
minimal or no impact on small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services 
concurs with this assessment. (The attached assessment does not reflect amendments to the 
bill.) 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Current Law/Bill Summary:  In general, and except as otherwise provided for by law, an 
officer, former officer, or former employee of the State or of a political subdivision may 
not disclose, in any manner, any tax information, as defined under § 13-201 of the 
Tax-General Article. Under the bill, the definition of “tax information” is clarified to 
include any tax return, information return, declaration of estimated tax, extension of time 
to file a return, or claim for refund that is filed with the tax collector and any amendment 
or supplement thereto, as specified. The bill further specifies that the term includes any 
information contained in a digital advertising gross revenues tax return.  
 
Section 13-203 of the Tax-General Article specifies various general exceptions to 
nondisclosure. The Comptroller or the State Department of Assessments and Taxation 
(SDAT) may disclose to a taxing official (as defined in § 13-203 of the Tax-General 
Article) information that is contained in any tax report or return, audit of a tax return, or 
report of a tax investigation and relates to the imposition, assessment, and collection of 
taxes or to any other matter about taxation generally if (1) the Comptroller or SDAT is 
satisfied that the tax information is to be used only for tax purposes; (2) the taxing official’s 
jurisdiction makes similar information available to the appropriate officials of the State; 
and (3) in the case of another state, its laws provide for adequate confidentiality of 
Maryland tax returns or other information.  
 
Among other specified exceptions to nondisclosure, § 13-203(c) lists additional individuals 
and entities to which tax information may be disclosed – in some cases, subject to specified 
conditions and limitations – such as the Maryland Tax Court, specified legal 
representatives of the State, specified license issuing authorities of the State, specified local 
and federal officials, and specified State agencies with respect to the administration of 
specified provisions of law. Under the bill:  
 
 
this list is expanded to include a person, governmental entity, or tax compliance 
organization (as defined by the bill) for the purpose of assisting the Comptroller in 
tax compliance activity;  
 
before disclosing tax information in accordance with the bill’s authorization or to 
certain other persons and entities listed under § 13-203(c), the Comptroller must 
require the party to whom the information is to be disclosed to enter into a binding,

HB 454/ Page 3 
written data use agreement, the terms of which must be prescribed by the 
Comptroller according to the Comptroller’s data security policies, consistent with 
State and federal requirements, and in compliance with specified provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code (in other cases, the Comptroller may, in its sole discretion, 
require a person or governmental entity to whom tax information is disclosed under 
§ 13-203(c) to enter into a binding written data use agreement); and  
 
the Comptroller must adequately supervise specified recipients of tax information 
at all times. 
 
Pursuant to § 13-1018 of the Tax-General Article, an officer, employee, former officer, or 
former employee of the State or of a political subdivision who makes an unlawful 
disclosure of tax information is guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction, subject to a 
fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. Under the bill, this prohibition 
and related penalties apply to officers, employees, former officers, and former employees 
of persons, governmental entities, and tax compliance organizations to which tax 
information has been disclosed under the bill’s authorization. 
 
Background:  The Comptroller’s Office advises that the bill furthers tax compliance 
efforts by authorizing the Comptroller to enter into data-sharing agreements with outside 
entities, such as the Multistate Tax Commission and Northeastern States Tax Officials 
Association, to assist the Comptroller’s Compliance Division with complex audit activities 
while ensuring adequate protections for confidential tax data. 
 
State and Local Fiscal Effect:  To the extent that the bill’s authorization results in 
increased tax compliance, State general and special fund revenues, special fund 
expenditures for local highway user revenue grants, local income tax revenues, local 
highway user revenues, and other local revenues may increase beginning as early as 
fiscal 2025. The Comptroller’s Office can handle any increase in tax compliance activity 
with existing budgeted resources. The expanded application of existing misdemeanor 
penalty provisions is not anticipated to materially affect State or local revenues or 
expenditures. 
 
It is assumed that State and local entities subject to the bill’s provisions relating to written 
data use agreements can comply with the terms of such agreements with existing budgeted 
resources.  
 
 
Additional Information 
 
Recent Prior Introductions:  Similar legislation has not been introduced within the last 
three years.

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
TITLE OF BILL:  Disclosure of Tax Information - Tax Compliance Activity and Binding 
Data Use Agreements 
 
BILL NUMBER:  HB0454 
 
PREPARED BY:  Justin Hayes, Director of State Affairs 
 
 
 
PART A.  ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
  X   WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
        WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND 
SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
PART B. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
This bill authorizes the Office of the Comptroller to enter into data-sharing arrangements 
with outside entities – such as the Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) and the 
Northeastern States Tax Officials Association (NESTOA) – to assist our Compliance 
Division with complex audit activities, requires a signed data use agreement for any and 
all data sharing relationships that involve taxpayer information, and reinforces that 
individuals who come in contact with disclosed tax data are not allowed to disclose 
unless expressly authorized in a binding data use agreement.  There is no direct impact on 
small businesses anticipated by this legislation, aside from potential increased audit 
activity may be possible based on partnerships with other tax compliance authorities.
