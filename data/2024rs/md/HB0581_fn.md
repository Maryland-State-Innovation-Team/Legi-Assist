Enrolled - Revised 
House Bill 581 
(The Speaker, et al.) (By Request - Administration) 
Health and Government Operations 
Education, Energy, and the Environment 
 
State Government - Permits, Licenses, and Certificates - Processing (Transparent 
Government Act of 2024) 
 
   
This Administration bill requires each principal department and independent unit of State 
government, by October 1, 2024, to (1) create a catalog containing specified information 
of each type of permit, license, or certificate that it issues and (2) submit the catalog to the 
Governor. By December 1, 2024, each principal department and independent unit must 
post on its website an interim description, to the extent practicable, of the application 
process for each permit, license, or certificate it issues, including specified information; by 
October 1, 2025, and annually thereafter, a completed update of that information must be 
posted. The bill also establishes the Government Efficiency Commission, staffed by the 
Office of the Governor, the stated purpose of which is to enhance government efficiency 
and economic competitiveness by monitoring efficiency in the processing of permits, 
licenses, and certificates. By December 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, the commission 
must submit a report on its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the 
General Assembly. The bill takes effect July 1, 2024. 
 
 
Fiscal Summary 
 
State Effect:  While it is anticipated that affected State entities can create the required 
catalog and post the required information on their websites using existing budgeted 
resources, as discussed below, some State entities may not meet the catalog submission 
deadline. The Governor’s Office can staff the commission with existing resources, and any 
expense reimbursements for commission members are assumed to be minimal and 
absorbable within existing budgeted resources. Revenues are not directly affected. 
  
Local Effect:  The bill does not directly affect local government operations or finances.

Small Business Effect:  The Administration has determined that this bill has a meaningful 
impact on small business (attached). The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) 
generally disagrees with this assessment, as discussed below. (The attached assessment 
does not reflect amendments to the bill.) 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
Catalog of Permits, Licenses, and Certificates 
 
“Department” means a principal department of the Executive Branch of State government, 
as specified. “Independent unit” means a unit in the Executive Branch of State government 
that is not a department.  
 
The required catalog must include:  
 
 
a description of each permit, license, or certificate; 
 
the term for which each issued permit, license, or certificate is valid; 
 
the statutory and regulatory authority that (1) authorizes or requires the department 
or independent unit to issue the permit, license, or certificate and (2) establishes a 
timeline within which a department or independent unit must process and issue the 
permit, license, or certificate, if any; 
 
the method and process used to accept applications for each permit, license, or 
certificate, including a list of (1) prior significant updates to the method and process 
and (2) the current information technology system used, and any remaining 
associated tasks still performed manually with the system; 
 
an estimate of the length of time to (1) determine if an application is complete and 
(2) make a final determination to issue, waive, or deny the permit, license, or 
certificate;  
 
the application fee charged for each permit, license, or certificate and how the 
revenue collected from application fees is allocated;  
 
any statutory or regulatory authority that may impact an applicant’s ability to 
receive a permit, license, or certificate based on the criminal history of the applicant;  
 
an analysis and any recommendations on the appropriate length of time to promptly 
process completed applications for each permit, license, or certificate and factors 
impeding the timely processing of each permit, license, or certificate; and 
 
statutory or regulatory changes and resources that could expedite the processing 
timeline.

Government Efficiency Commission – Established 
 
The commission must: 
 
 
compile and index the reports submitted under the bill; 
 
review statutory and regulatory provisions that may impact the efficiency of 
processing permits, licenses, and certificates; and 
 
make recommendations on (1) any factors impeding prompt and fair processing of 
permits, licenses, and certificates; (2) strategies for improving permitting and 
licensing efficiency; and (3) removing barriers that hinder individuals and 
businesses from receiving permits, licenses, and certificates.  
 
Commission members may not receive compensation but are entitled to reimbursement for 
expenses, as specified. 
 
Current Law/Background:  
 
OneStop Portal 
 
The Department of Information Technology manages the OneStop Portal, a platform 
designed to consolidate all of the State’s licensure and certification platforms into a single 
online platform. The goal of OneStop is to retire outdated State paper-based applications 
and legacy databases used by many State agencies for licensing. However, not every 
permit, license, and certificate issued by State entities is available on OneStop. The permits, 
licenses, and certificates available on OneStop can be viewed here. 
 
Administration of State-issued Permits, Licenses, and Certificates – Generally 
 
Several principal departments and independent units of State government administer and 
oversee the issuance of permits, licenses, and certificates for various purposes. Permit, 
license, and certificate fees are generally distributed to the general fund or a special fund 
dedicated to the regulatory function addressed by the specific permit, license, or certificate. 
Examples of State agencies that issue permits, licenses, and certificates include:  
 
 
the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) oversees the licensure and 
certification of educators, nonpublic schools, and specified childcare providers;  
 
the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) issues State licenses for health care 
facilities and community-based programs operating in Maryland; MDH also houses 
20 independent health occupational boards that oversee the licensure and 
certification of various health-related professions, including acupuncturists, nurses, 
pharmacists and pharmacies, and physicians;

HB 581/ Page 4 
 
the Maryland Department of Labor oversees more than 20 professional licensing 
boards, commissions, and offices that issue licenses and certifications for, among 
others, barbers, electricians, locksmiths, cosmetologists, real estate agents, and 
plumbers;  
 
the Department of State Police (DSP) issues licenses related to firearms and 
professional licenses generally relating to security guards, security services, and 
special police officers, among other specified law enforcement-related professions; 
 
the Office of the State Fire Marshal within DSP oversees the testing, licensing, and 
regulation of nongovernmental electrical inspectors and sprinkler contractors, in 
addition to other licenses and certifications relating to fire protection and 
prevention; 
 
the Maryland Department of the Environment issues several permits, licenses, and 
certificates, including those relating to lead paint, mining, oil and gas, refuse 
disposal, natural wood waste, hazardous waste, controlled hazardous substances, 
animal feeding operations, composting, scrap tires, sewage sludge, water quality 
discharge permits, water and sewerage construction, water appropriation and use, 
well construction, drinking water quality, wetlands and waterways, erosion and 
sediment control, and waterworks and waste system operators; 
 
the Maryland Department of Agriculture issues various permits, licenses, and 
registrations, including those relating to nutrient management, weights and 
measures, food quality assurance (such as eggs, grain dealers, and organic 
production and handling operations), pesticides, fertilizers, turf and seed, animal 
feed, pet foods, veterinarians, nurseries, apiaries, and horse stables; 
 
the Department of Natural Resources issues several permits and licenses, including 
those relating to hunting, wildlife, fishing, aquaculture, vessels and boating, 
endangered species, roadside trees, tree experts, off-road vehicles, and open air 
burning; and 
 
the Maryland Department of Transportation issues various permits and licenses, 
including those related to driving motor vehicles, hauling, car dealers, junkyard and 
scrap metal processing, airports, highway access, and outdoor advertising. 
 
State Expenditures:  The bill is not anticipated to materially affect State expenditures, as 
nearly all affected State entities that provided information regarding the fiscal impact of 
the bill indicate that they can create and submit the required catalog – and post the required 
information on their respective websites – using existing budgeted resources. However, 
DLS notes that the bill provides only three months from the bill’s July 1, 2024 effective 
date for affected State entities to submit the catalog to the Governor. Therefore, some State 
entities may not be able to meet the October 1, 2024 deadline for submission.  
 
However, MSDE advises that it will cost approximately $200,000 in fiscal 2025 to procure 
a contractor to create the catalog and build webpages for its various units in order to meet

HB 581/ Page 5 
the bill’s catalog and website posting requirements. DLS disagrees and notes that every 
other department and unit of State government that responded to requests for information 
regarding the fiscal impact of the bill stated that they can comply with those requirements 
using existing budgeted resources. Therefore, it is anticipated that MSDE can create the 
catalog and post the required information on its website using existing resources.  
 
Small Business Effect:  The Administration has determined that this bill has a meaningful 
impact on small business but did not provide any explanation as to that determination. 
While the intent of the bill may be to make the application process for State-issued permits, 
licenses, and certificates less burdensome and more efficient, the bill does not directly 
improve or expedite the application process for licenses, permits, or certificates. 
Accordingly, the extent to which the bill has a meaningful impact on small businesses is 
unclear. DLS acknowledges that the stated purpose of the Government Efficiency 
Commission, which is established by the bill, is to enhance government efficiency and 
economic competitiveness by monitoring efficiency in the processing of permits, licenses, 
and certificates. Accordingly, to the extent the work of the commission improves efficiency 
and removes barriers in obtaining permits, licenses, and certificates, small businesses 
seeking those approvals may benefit.
