implementing a Purple Alert; (4) consult with SHA to establish a plan for providing 
information relevant to a Purple Alert to the public through the dynamic message sign 
system located across the State; and (5) consult with MSDE to develop a program that 
allows high school students to assist in the search for a missing person, complies with the 
requisite Maryland Comprehensive Assessment under specified regulations, and is 
consistent with the student service-learning guidelines developed by MSDE. DSP may 
consult with relevant stakeholders representing citizens with disabilities to develop 
regulations and procedures to carry out the bill’s provisions. 
 
A caregiver, as defined by the bill, or person filing a report regarding a missing person 
must immediately notify the local law enforcement agency with which the report was filed 
and DSP if the missing person who was the subject of the report is located and it is unlikely 
that the local law enforcement agency or DSP has knowledge that the missing person has 
been located. 
 
A “missing person” is an individual: 
 
 
whose whereabouts are unknown;  
 
who (1) has a cognitive impairment, mental disorder, intellectual or developmental 
disability, or brain injury that is not Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or a physical, 
mental, or emotional disability related to substance abuse or (2) is deaf, deafblind, 
hard of hearing, or late-deafened;  
 
whose disappearance poses a credible threat to the health and safety of the individual 
due to age, health, mental or physical disability, environment, or weather conditions, 
as determined by a law enforcement agency; and  
 
who does not meet the criteria for activation of a Silver Alert. 
 
Current Law:  Chapters 503 and 504 of 2009 created the statewide Silver Alert Program 
within DSP to provide a system for rapid dissemination of information to assist in locating 
a “missing person.” A “missing person” is defined as an individual:   
 
 
whose whereabouts are unknown; 
 
who suffers a cognitive impairment including a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or 
dementia to the extent that the individual requires assistance from a caregiver; and 
 
whose disappearance poses a credible threat to the health and safety of the individual 
due to age, health, mental or physical disability, environment, or weather conditions, 
as determined by a law enforcement agency. 
 
A caregiver or person filing a report regarding a missing person must immediately notify 
the local law enforcement agency with which the report was filed and DSP if the missing

person who was the subject of the report is located and it is unlikely that the local law 
enforcement agency or DSP has knowledge that the missing person has been located. 
 
The AMBER Alert Plan, also coordinated by DSP, is a voluntary partnership between local 
law enforcement agencies and broadcasters to activate an urgent bulletin in the most serious 
child abduction cases. 
 
Chapter 502 of 2018 required law enforcement agencies to enter all necessary and available 
information with regard to a missing person into the National Crime Information Center 
(NCIC) computer network within two hours after receipt of the minimum information 
necessary to make the entry. Among other things, NCIC maintains a database of records 
relating to missing persons (including children) who have been reported missing to law 
enforcement and there is a reasonable concern for their safety.
