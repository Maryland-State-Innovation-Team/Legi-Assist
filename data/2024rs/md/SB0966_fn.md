2024 Session 
 
FISCAL AND POLICY NOTE 
Enrolled - Revised 
Senate Bill 966 
(Senators Zucker and McCray) 
Budget and Taxation 
Appropriations 
 
Prior Authorizations of State Debt - Alterations 
 
 
This bill modifies authorizations of State debt in prior year capital budgets by extending 
deadlines for expending or encumbering funds, removing matching fund requirements, 
altering the jurisdiction in which a project is located, renaming grant recipients, and/or 
altering the purpose for which funds may be used. In some cases, altering the purpose of 
grant funds merely makes minor or technical changes for how the funds may be used; in 
other cases, grant funds may be reassigned/redistributed to an entirely different purpose 
within the same jurisdiction. The bill takes effect June 1, 2024.

authorization for State debt, and the matching fund must be certified prior to the grantee’s 
expending or encumbering State funds.

appropriation for a capital expenditure and a seven-year limitation on the authorization for 
State debt unless otherwise provided in an enabling act. The Act applies to all debt 
authorized on or after June 1, 1997.
