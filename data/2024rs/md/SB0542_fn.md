Analysis 
 
Bill Summary/Current Law:  “Brokerage relationship” means an agency relationship 
under a brokerage agreement between a client and a broker who has been authorized by the 
client to provide real estate brokerage services in a residential real estate transaction. A 
“brokerage agreement” means a written agreement between a broker and a client to provide 
real estate brokerage services under a brokerage relationship. 
 
Under current law, a brokerage relationship commences at the time that a client enters into 
a brokerage agreement and must continue until the completion of performance in 
accordance with the brokerage agreement or the earlier of (1) any date of expiration as 
agreed on by the parties in the brokerage agreement; (2) any mutually agreed on 
termination of the brokerage relationship; (3) a default by any party under the terms of the 
brokerage agreement; or (4) a termination under the relevant provisions of State law.

SB 542/ Page 2 
Under current law, the requirements for brokerage agreements apply to both agreements 
between a broker and a seller or lessor and agreements between a broker and buyer or 
lessee. The bill splits general brokerage agreement requirements under current law into 
two sections:  one governing the agreement between a broker and a seller or lessor; and 
another between a broker and a buyer or lessee. 
 
Similar to requirements under current law, the brokerage agreement between a broker and 
a seller or lessor under the bill must (1) have a definite termination date that is effective 
automatically without notice from the client; (2) state the amount of compensation to be 
paid to the broker; (3) state whether the broker is authorized to cooperate with other brokers 
and share compensation with the other brokers and the amount of the compensation 
described as a percentage of the purchase price, a specific dollar amount, or a combination 
of both; (4) explain the events or conditions that will entitle the broker to a commission or 
other compensation; and (5) contain a provision for the cancellation of the brokerage 
relationship by either the client or the broker or by mutual agreement of the client and the 
broker. 
 
As noted above, the bill establishes separate requirements for a brokerage agreement 
between a broker and a buyer or lessee. Such agreements must (1) have a definite 
termination date that is effective automatically without notice from the client; (2) state the 
amount of compensation to be paid to the broker, described as a percentage of the purchase 
price, a specific dollar amount, or a combination of both; (3) state whether the broker is 
authorized to receive some or all of the compensation to be paid to the broker from a person 
other than the client; (4) state the client’s rights and obligations regarding compensation to 
be paid to the broker if the broker is authorized to receive some or all of the compensation 
to be paid from the broker from a person other than the client; (5) explain the events that 
must occur (or conditions that must be met) in order for the broker to be entitled to a 
commission or other compensation; and (6) contain a provision for the cancellation of the 
brokerage relationship by either the client or the broker or by mutual agreement of the 
client and the broker.
