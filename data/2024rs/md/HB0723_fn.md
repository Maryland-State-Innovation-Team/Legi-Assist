Bill Summary:   
 
Rights of a Resident of a Facility 
 
Generally, under current law, “facility” means a related institution that, under the rules and 
regulations of MDH, is a comprehensive care facility or an extended care facility. Maryland 
regulations define “comprehensive care facility” as a nursing home that admits patients

suffering from disease or disabilities or advanced age, requiring medical service and 
nursing service rendered by or under the supervision of a registered nurse. “Extended care 
facility” means a nursing home that offers subacute care, providing treatment services for 
patients requiring inpatient care but who do not currently require continuous hospital 
services. 
 
Under current law, it is the policy of the State that, in addition to any other rights, each 
resident of a facility has the following basic rights:   
 
 
the right to be treated with consideration, respect, and full recognition of human 
dignity and individuality; 
 
the right to receive treatment, care, and services that are adequate, appropriate, and 
in compliance with relevant State and federal laws, rules, and regulations; 
 
the right to privacy; 
 
the right to be free from mental and physical abuse; 
 
the right to notice, procedural fairness, and humane treatment when being 
transferred or discharged from a facility; 
 
the right to participate in decision making regarding transitions in care, including a 
transfer or discharge from a facility; 
 
the right to expect and receive appropriate assessment, management, and treatment 
of pain as an integral component of the patient’s care; 
 
the right to be free from physical and chemical restraints, except for residents that a 
physician authorizes for a clearly indicated medical need; 
 
the right to receive respect and privacy in a medical care program; and 
 
the right to manage personal financial affairs. 
 
Involuntary Transfer or Discharge 
 
In general, under current law, a facility must provide a resident with a written notice 
30 days before any proposed discharge or transfer and provide the resident with the 
opportunity for a hearing before the discharge or transfer. A resident of a facility may not 
be transferred or discharged involuntarily except for the following reasons:  (1) the transfer 
or discharge is necessary for the resident’s welfare and their needs cannot be met in the 
facility; (2) the transfer or discharge is appropriate because the resident’s health has 
improved sufficiently so that the resident no longer needs the services provided by the 
facility; (3) the health or safety of an individual in a facility is endangered; (4) the resident 
has failed, after reasonable and appropriate notice, to pay for a stay at the facility; or (5) the 
facility ceases to operate. 
 
Under current law, a facility may not involuntarily discharge or transfer a resident unless, 
within 48 hours before the discharge or transfer, the facility has (1) provided or obtained a

HB 723/ Page 3 
comprehensive medical assessment and evaluation, a post discharge plan of care, and 
written documentation from the attending physician indicating the transfer or discharge is 
in accordance with the post discharge plan of care, and (2) provided specified information 
to the resident concerning the resident’s rights to make decisions concerning health care. 
 
Current law authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil money penalty of up to $10,000 for 
(1) each violation by a facility of involuntary discharge or transfer requirements, or 
(2) each willful or grossly negligent violation by a resident’s agent or legal representative 
regarding involuntary discharge or transfer requirements. If a civil money penalty is 
imposed, the facility, agent, or legal representative of the resident must have the right to 
appeal from an order imposing the civil money penalty. A resident, resident’s agent, or 
resident’s attorney, or the Attorney General on behalf of the resident, who believes that an 
involuntary discharge or transfer that violates the specified requirements is imminent or 
has taken place may request injunctive relief from a circuit court. In an action brought by 
the Attorney General, the Attorney General may request that the court impose a civil 
penalty of up to $100,000 for each violation of specified resident involuntary transfer or 
discharge requirements by a facility. 
 
Resident Bill of Rights 
 
Under current law, an “assisted living program” is a residential or facility-based program 
that provides housing and supportive services, supervision, personalized assistance, 
health-related services, or a combination of such services that meets the needs of 
individuals who need assistance with the activities of daily living in a way that promotes 
optimum dignity and independence for the individuals. Assisted living programs are 
licensed by the Office of Health Care Quality within MDH. MDH must, among other 
things, establish a resident bill of rights for residents of assisted living program facilities. 
 
The bill alters the definition of “resident bill of rights” for residents of assisted living 
program facilities to include, at a minimum:   
 
 
the right to be treated with consideration, respect, and full recognition of human 
dignity and individuality; 
 
the right to receive treatment, care, and services that are adequate, appropriate, and 
in compliance with relevant federal and state laws, rules, and regulations; 
 
the right to be free from mental and physical abuse; 
 
the right to be free from mental, verbal, sexual, and physical abuse, neglect, or 
involuntary seclusion or exploitation; 
 
the right to notice, procedural fairness, and humane treatment when being 
transferred or discharged from a facility;

 
the right to participate in decision making regarding transitions in care, including a

a physician authorizes for a clearly indicated medical need; and 
 
the right to manage personal financial affairs.
