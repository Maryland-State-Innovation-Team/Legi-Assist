Analysis 
 
Bill Summary:   
 
New Manufactured Homes or Modular Dwellings 
 
The bill requires a legislative body of a local jurisdiction to allow the placement of a new 
manufactured home or modular dwelling in a zone that allows single-family residential 
uses if the home or dwelling: 
 
 
meets a specified definition of a manufactured home and is, or will be after purchase, 
converted to real property in accordance with specified provisions of the Real 
Property Article, which includes attachment of the manufactured home to a 
permanent foundation; 
 
meets a specified definition of a modular dwelling, including that the modular 
dwelling is installed and set up according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an 
approved foundation and support system; or 
 
is located on land (1) currently or previously owned by the federal government; 
(2) greater than 80 acres in size; and (3) that was the site of a former U.S. military 
reservation. 
 
Housing Expansion and Affordability 
 
The bill creates a new subtitle within the Land Use Article (Title 7, Subtitle 5, “Housing 
Expansion and Affordability”) specifying local zoning requirements for specified 
affordable housing development statewide. The new subtitle, among other things, requires 
local jurisdictions to allow specified densities and uses in certain zoning areas, for 
“qualified projects” on (1) specified property formerly owned by the State; (2) specified 
property currently or formerly owned by the federal government; (3) property within 
three-quarters of a mile of a rail station located in the State; and (4) specified land that is 
wholly owned by a nonprofit organization or that includes improvements owned by an 
entity that is controlled by a nonprofit organization. 
 
More specifically, “qualified project” means a residential project that consists of new 
construction or substantial renovation, and meets one of the four following criteria:   
 
 
Property Formerly Owned by the State – (1) is on property that was formerly owned 
by the State, consists of more than one building, includes at least one building that 
was built more than 50 years before the date of application for the project, and is 
appropriate for redevelopment as determined by the Secretary of Housing and 
Community Development; (2) contains at least 25% of units that are affordable 

END OF PAGE 2

START OF PAGE 3
    
HB 538/ Page 3 
dwelling units; and (3) is deed-restricted to include 25% of units that are affordable 
dwelling units for a period of at least 40 years; 


property that is currently or was formerly owned by the federal government, is 
greater than 80 acres in size, and was the site of a former U.S. military reservation; 
(2) contains at least 25% of units that are affordable dwelling units; and (3) is 
deed-restricted to include 25% of units that are affordable dwelling units for a period 
of at least 40 years; 
 
Property within Three-quarters of a Mile of a Rail Station Located in the 
State – (1) is on property that is located within three-quarters of a mile of a rail 
station located in the State (subject to the exceptions discussed below); (2) contains 
at least 15% of units that are affordable dwelling units (unless a county or 
municipality, by December 31, 2024, has a requirement equal to or exceeding the 
minimum 15% requirement, in which case at least 20% of units must be affordable 
dwelling units); and (3) is deed-restricted to include 15% of units that are affordable 
dwelling units for a period of at least 40 years (unless a county or municipality, by 
December 31, 2024, has a requirement equal to or exceeding the 15% requirement, 
in which case, the requirement is 20%); or 
 
Land/Improvements Owned/Controlled by a Nonprofit Organization – (1) is on 
land, including land that is subject to a ground lease, that is wholly owned by a 
nonprofit organization or includes improvements owned by an entity that is 
controlled by a nonprofit organization; (2) contains at least 25% of units that are 
affordable dwelling units; and (3) is deed-restricted to include 25% of units that are 
affordable dwelling units for a period of at least 40 years. 
 
A “qualified project” may not qualify under the “property within three-quarters of a mile 
of a rail station” criteria: 
 
 
if (1) the rail station is located on the campus of an institution of higher education 
as defined in § 10-101 of the Education Article or (2) only a portion of the property 
is located within three-fourths of a mile of the rail station; or 
 
in an area zoned for single-family residential use (1) on January 1, 2024, and 
(2) during any process to increase allowable density under the bill. 
 
“Affordable” means that housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household’s income. 
 
“Affordable dwelling unit” means a dwelling unit that is affordable to households earning 
60% or less of the area median income.

HB 538/ Page 4 
“Rail station” means a present or planned (1) MARC station along the Penn, Camden, or 
Brunswick lines; (2) Baltimore Metro SubwayLink station; (3) Baltimore Light RailLink 
station; (4) Metrorail system station in the State; or (5) any other passenger rail station. 
 
“Controlled by” means a business structure in which a nonprofit organization is a managing 
member, general partner, or otherwise controlling entity with a for-profit member or 
partner as demonstrated by an attorney licensed in the State.

§ 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and has been designated as such for at least 
three years. 
 
 
Densities and Uses 
 
Under the new subtitle, a local jurisdiction must allow the density of a qualified project to 
exceed the density otherwise authorized in a district or zone as follows. A qualified project, 
in an area zoned:   
 
 
for single-family residential use, may include middle housing units; 
 
for multifamily residential use, (1) must have a density limit that exceeds by 
30% the allowable density in that zone for uses that are not part of a qualified project 
and (2) may consist of mixed-use; 
 
for nonresidential use (or on land that is currently or was formerly owned by the 
federal government, is more than 80 acres in size, and was the site of a former  
U.S. military reservation), may consist of mixed-use, with density limits that do not 
exceed the highest allowable density in the local jurisdiction’s multifamily 
residential zones (provided that, in an area zoned for nonresidential use, the 
qualified project complies with the public health impact assessment requirement 
described below); and 
 
for mixed-use, (1) may include 30% more housing units than are allowed in that 
zone for uses that are not part of a qualified project, for projects that qualify under 
the “property within three-quarters of a mile of a rail station” and 
“land/improvements owned/controlled by a nonprofit organization” criteria, and 
(2) may consist of residential development with density limits that do not exceed 
the greater of the highest allowable density in the local jurisdiction’s residential 
zones or six units per gross acre, for projects that qualify under the “property 
formerly owned by the State” and “property currently or formerly owned by the 
federal government” criteria.  
 
The bill establishes that (1) the increased density limits for qualified projects are in addition 
to increased density that is allowed or required by a local jurisdiction; (2) the increased 

END OF PAGE 4

START OF PAGE 5
    
HB 538/ Page 5 
density limits for qualified projects are not further increased if a project meets the definition 
of a qualified project under more than one of the four criteria listed above; and (3) the bill’s 
increased density limits do not apply in a district or zone located on agricultural land or 
conservation property. 
 
“Middle housing” means (1) duplexes; (2) triplexes; (3) quadplexes; (4) cottage clusters; 
or (5) town houses. 
 
“Cottage cluster” means a grouping of not fewer than four detached housing units per acre 
that (1) have a footprint of less than 900 square feet each and (2) include a common 
courtyard. 
 
“Mixed-use” means any combination of a residential use with a recreational, office, dining, 
or retail use, and does not mean any combination of a residential use with an industrial or 
hazardous use.  
 
 
Unreasonable Limitations or Requirements 
 
Under the new subtitle, the bill prohibits a local jurisdiction from imposing any 
unreasonable limitation or requirements on a qualified project under the subtitle, including 
limitations on or requirements concerning (1) height; (2) setback; (3) bulk; (4) parking; 
(5) loading, dimensional, or area; or (6) similar requirements. 
 
“Unreasonable limitation or requirement” includes any limitation or requirement that 
amounts to a de facto denial by having a substantial adverse impact on (1) the viability of 
an affordable housing development in a qualified project; (2) the degree of affordability of 
affordable dwelling units in a qualified project; or (3) the allowable density or number of 
units of the qualified project. 
 
 
Public Hearings 
 
Under the new subtitle, except as otherwise provided or required by State law, a local 
government is prohibited from requiring that a qualified project under the subtitle be 
reviewed at more than (1) two public hearings before the local governing body; 
(2) two public hearings before the planning commission; (3) one public hearing before a 
historic district commission or historic preservation commission; and (4) one public 
hearing before the board of appeals. 
 
 
Public Health Impact Assessment 
 
Before a qualified project is authorized to exceed the density in an area zoned for 
nonresidential use, the entity responsible for the qualified project must (1) conduct a public 

END OF PAGE 5

START OF PAGE 6
    
HB 538/ Page 6 
health impact assessment and (2) receive approval of the public health impact assessment 
from DHCD. A public health impact assessment must evaluate potential public health 
impacts associated with the proximity of the qualified project to any health hazards within 
the area zoned for nonresidential use. DHCD may not approve a public health impact 
assessment if the assessment shows that residential use in the nonresidential zone would 
present a substantial risk to the health and safety of the residents. DHCD must adopt 
regulations to implement these requirements. 
 
Historic Property Revitalization Director 
 
The bill establishes a Historic Property Revitalization Director within DHCD and requires 
that a position identification number be created in DHCD for the director. The director 
must:   
 
 
support the work of the Smart Growth Subcabinet; 
 
collect and maintain from State agencies that own property an inventory of 
State-owned buildings that are greater than 50 years old to be used for prioritizing 
physical assessments and, if applicable, determining eligibility for the National 
Register of Historic Places; 
 
in consultation with the Smart Growth Subcabinet and to determine the highest and 
best value for the State’s disposition of property, support studies and consultations 
relevant to (1) stabilization; (2) mothballing; (3) environmental impacts; 
(4) economic prospects; and (5) long-term ground leases; 
 
work with DHCD, the Department of Commerce, and other members of the Smart 
Growth Subcabinet to identify existing State and federal programs and financing 
mechanisms that may be leveraged to enhance the successful redevelopment of 
property; and  
 
work with the Department of General Services (DGS) Office of Real Estate during 
the disposition process of relevant property. 
 
The director, in consultation with the Smart Growth Subcabinet, must submit an annual 
report to the General Assembly by October 1, 2026, and each October 1 thereafter, on the 
progress of the director’s efforts. The director must receive a salary as provided in the State 
budget. 
 
Current Law:   
 
Land Use – Generally 
 
State law specifies that it is the policy of the State that (1) the orderly development and use 
of land and structures requires comprehensive regulation through implementation of 

END OF PAGE 6

START OF PAGE 7
    
HB 538/ Page 7 
planning and zoning controls and (2) planning and zoning controls must be implemented 
by local government. State law incudes various provisions authorizing local governments 
to regulate the location, size, and use of structures through zoning regulations. 
 
Land Use – Housing 
 
 
Comprehensive Plans – Housing Element and Housing Vision 
 
Under the Land Use Article, local jurisdictions are required to enact, adopt, amend, and 
execute a comprehensive plan that includes specified visions and elements. At least once 
every 10 years, each local jurisdiction must review its comprehensive plan and, if 
necessary, revise or amend the plan. 
 
The comprehensive plan must include a housing “element” and implement a housing 
“vision”:   
 
 
Housing Element – the housing element may include goals, objectives, policies, 
plans, and standards, and must address the need for affordable housing within the 
local jurisdiction, including workforce housing and low-income housing; and 
 
Housing Vision – the housing vision is that a range of housing densities, types, and 
sizes provides residential options for citizens of all ages and incomes. 
 
Development Mechanisms 
 
Title 7, Subtitle 1 (Development Mechanisms) of the Land Use Article:   
 
 
authorizes and encourages a local jurisdiction – in order to encourage the 
preservation of natural resources or the provision of affordable housing and to 
facilitate orderly development and growth – to enact local laws providing for or 
requiring (1) the planning, staging, or provision of adequate public facilities and 
affordable housing; (2) off-site improvements or the dedication of land for public 
facilities essential for a development; (3) moderately priced dwelling unit programs; 
(4) mixed use developments; (5) cluster developments; (6) planned unit 
developments; (7) alternative subdivision requirements that meet minimum 
performance standards set by the local jurisdiction and reduce infrastructure costs; 
(8) floating zones; (9) incentive zoning; and (10) performance zoning; 
 
authorizes a legislative body of a local jurisdiction to enact local laws providing for 
the transfer, with or without consideration, of real property belonging to the local 
jurisdiction to a public or private entity, to use in developing or preserving 
affordable housing; and 

END OF PAGE 7

START OF PAGE 8
    
HB 538/ Page 8 
 
establishes that the authority granted under the subtitle is not intended to limit a 
local jurisdiction’s authority to (1) exercise any planning and zoning powers not 
expressly authorized under the subtitle or (2) adopt other methods to facilitate 
orderly development and growth, encourage the preservation of natural resources, 
or provide affordable housing. 
 
 
Inclusionary Zoning 
 
Title 7, Subtitle 4 (Inclusionary Zoning) of the Land Use Article, authorizes a legislative 
body of a local jurisdiction – in order to promote the creation of housing that is affordable 
by individuals and families with low- or moderate-incomes – to enact local laws 
(1) imposing inclusionary zoning, and awarding density bonuses, to create affordable 
housing units and (2) restricting the use, cost, and resale of the housing created. 
 
Historic Property 
 
 
Inventory and Registers 
 
The Maryland Historical Trust (MHT) is required to compile:   
 
 
a Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties that consists of districts, sites, 
buildings, structures, and other objects of known or potential value to the prehistory, 
history, upland and underwater archaeology, architecture, engineering, and culture 
of the State (statute also similarly requires MHT to direct and conduct a 
comprehensive statewide survey of historic properties in cooperation with units of 
the federal government, State units, political subdivisions, private organizations, 
and individuals); and 
 
a Maryland Register of Historic Properties to include all properties in the State that 
are listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places of the 
U.S. Department of the Interior. 
 
MHT must adopt regulations specifying procedures and eligibility standards for including 
properties in the Maryland Register of Historic Places and the MHT director must 
determine whether a property is eligible to be listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places. 
 

END OF PAGE 8

START OF PAGE 9
    
HB 538/ Page 9 
 
State Property 
 
In cooperation with MHT and subject to available resources, each State unit must 
(1) establish a program to identify, document, and nominate to MHT each property owned 
or controlled by the State unit that appears to qualify for the Maryland Register of Historic 
Properties; (2) ensure that no property listed in or eligible to be listed in the Maryland 
Register of Historic Properties is inadvertently transferred, sold, demolished, destroyed, 
substantially altered, or allowed to deteriorate significantly; and (3) use any available 
historic building under its control to the extent prudent and practicable before acquiring, 
constructing, or leasing a building to carry out its responsibilities. If it is prudent, 
practicable, and in the State’s best interest to do so, a State unit that transfers a surplus 
property listed in or eligible to be listed in the Maryland Register of Historic Properties 
must ensure that the transfer provides for the preservation or enhancement of the property. 
 
Smart Growth Subcabinet 
 
The Smart Growth Subcabinet consists of the secretaries of various agencies, including 
DHCD, Commerce, DGS, the Maryland Department of Planning, and others. 
 
The subcabinet must:   
 
 
provide a forum for discussion of interdepartmental issues relating to activities that 
affect growth, development, neighborhood conservation, and resource management; 
 
work together to promote the understanding of smart growth; 
 
work together to create, enhance, support, and revitalize sustainable communities 
across the State; 
 
meet at least biannually with county and municipal elected leaders and planning 
officials to discuss local government issues relating to activities that affect smart 
growth, development, neighborhood conservation, and resource management; 
 
make recommendations to specified State agencies; 
 
evaluate and report annually to the Governor and the General Assembly on the 
implementation of the State’s smart growth policy; and 
 
perform other duties assigned by the Governor. 
 
Background:  DHCD indicates that (1) the pace of new housing construction decreased 
after the 2008 housing recession and has never fully recovered and (2) housing costs have 
steadily risen over the past decade, with more significant increases in recent years in 
construction costs and mortgage rates. According to DHCD, 52% of renters and 23% of 
homeowners in Maryland spend more than 30% of their income on housing.

State Fiscal Effect:   
 
Department of Housing and Community Development 
 
DHCD general fund expenditures increase by $73,674 in fiscal 2025, which accounts for 
the bill’s January 1, 2025, effective date, and by ongoing amounts in future years (which 
range from $130,180 in fiscal 2026 to $148,082 in fiscal 2029) to hire the Historic Property 
Revitalization Director. This estimate includes a salary, fringe benefits, one-time start-up 
costs, and ongoing operating expenses.

Salaries and Fringe Benefits 
$66,688 
Operating Expenses

Total FY 2025 State Expenditures 
$73,674 
 
Future year expenditures reflect a full salary with annual increases and employee turnover 
as well as annual increases in ongoing operating expenses. 
 
DHCD can implement the required approval process for public health impact assessments 
for qualified projects authorized to exceed the density in an area zoned for nonresidential 
use, including adoption of regulations, with existing budgeted resources.  
 
Although the bill seeks to remove barriers to, and expedite, affordable housing projects 
that may receive funding under DHCD programs, the bill does not directly affect those 
programs or budgeted funding under the programs. 
 
Other Agencies  
 
The Smart Growth Subcabinet, Commerce, and DGS can consult/work with the Historic 
Property Revitalization Director, as specified, with existing budgeted resources. 
 
Local Fiscal Effect:   
 
Local Implementation 
 
Based on information received from a small number of local jurisdictions, the bill is 
expected to be implemented, administratively, with existing resources in many 
jurisdictions, but some may require additional resources (e.g., an additional staff position 
or contractual services) to manage the review and inspection of qualified project 
development under the bill. Local jurisdictions also collect development-related fees from 
such development.

HB 538/ Page 11 
Infrastructure 
 
Infrastructure spending by local jurisdictions may increase or accelerate to the extent the 
bill allows for development to outpace infrastructure capacity by allowing for greater 
development density than planned for by a local jurisdiction. The extent to which potential 
additional strain on infrastructure under the bill may result in increased/accelerated 
infrastructure spending, and the potential magnitude of that spending, cannot be reliably 
estimated and depends on the infrastructure capacity of an area in which a development is 
proposed, and the size and density of the proposed development(s).

ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
 
TITLE OF BILL:  Land Use - Affordable Housing - Zoning Density and Permitting 
(Housing Expansion and Affordability Act of 2024) 
 
BILL NUMBER: 
HB0538 
 
PREPARED BY: 
Brad Fallon 
 
 
 
PART A.  ECONOMIC IMPACT RATING 
 
This agency estimates that the proposed bill: 
 
___ 
WILL HAVE MINIMAL OR NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESS 
 
OR 
 
 
  X      WILL HAVE MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MARYLAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
     
 
 
PART B.  ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 
This legislation creates regulatory incentives for qualified residential projects that meet 
certain affordability, ownership, and/or location requirements. As such, this legislation 
can be expected to incentivize economic development as residential and mixed use 
projects are constructed.  
 
The legislation seeks to address Maryland’s estimated 96,000 housing unit shortage 
which adversely impacts the state’s cost of living, business attractiveness, and 
competitiveness for skilled workforce. Both through direct investments and addressing a 
supply shortage, this legislation is anticipated to have a significant positive economic 
impact.
