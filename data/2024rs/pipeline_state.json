      "bill_summary": "This bill modifies the administration and funding of public school construction in Maryland. It establishes a 100% State share of eligible costs for specific major renovation projects in high schools with high poverty rates in counties with low State shares and limited enrollment. The bill repeals the scheduled 2026 expiration of the School Safety Grant Program, ensuring its continuation. It also accelerates State payments to Prince George's County for its public-private partnership (P3) school construction program, reduces the annual mandated appropriation for the Nancy K. Kopp Public School Facilities Priority Fund from $80 million to $70 million starting in fiscal 2027, and creates a workgroup to study how facility assessments should influence funding decisions.",

The legislation increases the statutory caps for these awards, establishes criteria for administrative law judges to determine the amount of relief, and provides an exemption from monetary relief for certain accessibility violations if the respondent takes prompt corrective action. Additionally, it requires MCCR to submit annual reports on the bill's impact for five years.",
